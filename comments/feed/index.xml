					<description><![CDATA[Liebe Jelena,
danke, f√ºr die tolle Inspiration und den gut geschriebenen, historischen Einstieg.
Ich m√∂chte diese Pilze <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f344.png" alt="üçÑ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> f√ºr den Adventskalender meiner Tochter backen und ich vermute, sie selbst w√ºrde damit in Serienproduktion gehen und Familie und Freunde damit zu Weihnachten beschenken. Sie liebt Pilze.

Hast du das Rezept noch einmal gebacken seit dem letzten Jahr und k√∂nntest die Zutaten-Mengenangaben korrigieren?

Ich w√ºrde mich wahnsinnig freuen.

Danke auch f√ºr die Hilfreichen Kommentare auf dieser Seite.

Hello Tony, thank you for your comment. Next time just add an extra egg. And make sure that kasha absorbs all water when cooking. Please, try it one more time, it&#039;s an excellent dish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Yelena, I tried your Kasha Cakes with Mushroom Sauce recipe. I followed all the steps precisely but I could not get the cakes to form into patties. They simply would not hold together.
I will confess I am fairly new to cooking and I am certain an experienced cook would have come up with a remedy. All was not lost as I was able to salvage the ingredients and simply cooked  them in bulk and served as a side.
Is there something I could have done to help form the mix into patties? I plan on trying again since this is an excellent recipe.
Thank you

I think you are right, Something wrong with the measurements. I have to rebake them and see what is going on with this recipe. I will make a new post and link it, so people will go to the new place. Now I am curious myself. Thank you for a such detailed message. You have a wonderful holidays!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Based on some of the comments and my own experience, I&#039;m not sure this recipe works. I suspect it may be due to a lack of weights for each ingredient - given that it&#039;s an older recipe the original amounts may not have been measured correctly, leading to inconsistent results. I weighed out all of my ingredients (converting cups to grams) and still got poor results. I then shaped and froze my dough for about an hour and a half and still my stems sank as much as they did without freezing. Additionally, the advice of cooking more than one tray at a time and letting the heat out of the oven to rotate the trays is not great advice... I actually found my cookies were still quite soft after 20 minutes when I tried to do two trays at once. I also haven&#039;t been fortunate enough to have an oven in my adult life that could fit two half-sheets side-by-side, let alone rotate them together! 

The second batch I baked was frozen, placed in a preheated oven, and also baked just a single sheet but it didn&#039;t make a difference. At 12 minutes the cookies were not only underdone (stems and caps) but they had lost their shapes completely (stems). Admittedly I wonder if the reviewers who said the recipe worked simply didn&#039;t have high hopes for the stems or assumed they shaped them incorrectly and so they didn&#039;t mind the final look...

I&#039;m thankful this recipe doesn&#039;t take many ingredients but disappointed as I was really looking forward to these. I found a similar recipe elsewhere that calls for a lot more flour that I am going to try.]]></description>
