					<description><![CDATA[Nowadays, we think of oysters as a luxury food, but a few centuries ago they where in such bountiful and accessible supply that people actually complained of having to eat too many. Too many oysters &#8211; can you imagine? Today is the Orthodox Christmas day. Marry Christmas to all who celebrates it on this day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vol-au-vent is a puffy tartlet from flaky dough. Dough raises up during baking and takes shape of a small cup or basket. Variety of fillings go into baked dough baskets  and they are served cold or hot. Vol-au-vents are of French origin, first time made by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême. Name of this pastry points to the type of dough used in it. The initial idea behind volauvents was to make them very lite as opposed to the ones made of shortcrust dough. There is another name for vol-au-vents – bouchées. Authorship of first bouchées is attributed to wife of King Louis XV, Maria Leschinsky. She loved small single bite type of foods and hence the name – “bouchées à la reine”, queen’s bites. Despite of vol-au-vents French origin, they are very popular in Russian cuisine, you can find variety of their recipes in old cook books of Soviet time. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page. My new still life &#8211; Zakusky: Traditional Russian Small Plates Vol-au-vents are popular worldwide as well. They are usually made a “single bite size”, but occasionally you can find large ones too stuffed with meat or fish. These usually are the main course and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Luxurious Lobster Bisque &#38; Other Unique Lobster Recipes That Are a Must Try This Summer Are you looking for a dinner that isn&#8217;t just the same beef, pork, or chicken dish? Maybe you&#8217;re planning to cook a fancy dinner for you and your significant other. Lobster is a great way to take your dinner plans to the next level. But rather than going with the typical lobster tail and butter, why not consider one of the following recipes? Grilled Lobster Mango Tango This recipe is more involved than the first, but if you want something unique, it&#8217;s a great option. To make this lobster dish, you&#8217;ll need to prepare a Moho Cubaneau sauce and a mango vinaigrette dressing. Other ingredients include mesclun salad greens, oranges, limes, mango, Asian chili paste, and of course, lobster. It&#8217;s a great Latin dish that will titillate the senses. Lobster Ravioli With Brown Sauce If you&#8217;re willing to put forth the effort, lobster ravioli is an elegant dish that will impress your sweetheart or whomever you make it for. (Here&#8217;s a great tip; using wonton wrappers instead of homemade ravioli is a smart way to save time when preparing ravioli!) Fresh ingredients are really what make this [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Letting people serve themselves is the simplest way to host a Sunday brunch. Preplanning the food table, as well as the drinks, make for an event where you can actually sit down and enjoy your quests. After deciding on your menu, choose your serving platters and tools. Set up your buffet table starting with plates, utensils, and napkins, then lay out the food in the order you would like to serve it, savory dishes first, sweets and fruits at the end. For drinks, set out glasses in a few different sizes, a bucket of ice, and selection of drinks. Have a bottle of champagne open and be sure to offer orange juice and a pitcher of water with lemon slices. Here is my menu sample with few fresh recipes for a Spring Sunday Brunch: Arctic Char with Tomatoes &#38; Asparagus Eggs Cocotte with Mushrooms &#38; Green Peas Strawberry Scones with Blood Orange Icing Although the Eskimos and the people of the northern parts of Scandinavia and the British Isles have enjoyed Arctic char for centuries, it is obviously a secret that they have kept to themselves. Possibly one of the best tasting of the anadromous fish (although some species are [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shad was known as elft, the eleven fish, to the early Dutch settlers. It was on the 11th day of March each year that the first shad were caught and cooked on a plank, a method the settlers learned from the Indians. Shad were so abundant in colonial days that it became quite fashionable among some of the well-to-do. Many of them ate shad on the sly, fearing others would think them unable to afford more expensive food. Shad is particularly bony fish. An Indian legend has it that the shad was a discontented porcupine that asked the gods to be changed, following which it was turned inside out. Shad has a rich, sweet, very distinctive flavor, a high-fat content, and perfect texture for broiling, baking, pan-frying, or poaching. A further harbinger of the advent of spring is yet another special treatment given to us by the shad &#8211; the delicious and delicate roe. Shad roe comes in skeins or sets, joined by a thin membrane. One important rule when you cook the roe, always handle the roe with great care and don&#8217;t separate the halves until after you&#8217;ve cooked them. Also, plunging them into iced water before you cook [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These fishcakes are delicious, no matter how many you are going to make they will disappear in front of your eyes. Usually I have a few photographs for a recipe, but today I have only two photos for you, you know why? I have started eating the cakes from my photo shoot-)) They are great for a party, your friends are going to love it. You can make the tuna cakes few hours before the meal, but before serving put them in the oven preheated to 375F for about 10-15 minutes. The fishcakes will be hot and crispy, and ready to be eaten-)) Serve them with tartar sauce or Country Rémoulade sauce.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cape Cod was a beautiful dream, the one you love to come back again and again. My friend told me that if I come to Cape Cod in October, I can pick enough wild mushrooms for the next three years. I don&#8217;t remember the last time I picked forest mushrooms, but I sure love to cook, dry, and marinade them. This would be a treat to cook mushrooms from the place as unique as Cape Cod! We stayed in The Mansion at Ocean Edge Resort &#38; Golf Club, Brewster, ideal resort for relaxing and enjoying a few days in the tranquility of Cape Cod. Rooms are spacious, luxurious and well furnished. However, in such an upscale hotel, I was deceived by the food in both the pub located in the mansion and The Linx Tavern at the golf. I really did not like anything I had. Tasteless fish dishes, lack of spices, something that you would&#8217;ve had in OK hotel restaurant 20 years ego. But I do recommend the nice place for dinner The Beacon Room, in Orleans, MA &#8211;&#160;elegant seafood with an Italian bent. Here are some healthy and simple seafood recipes that you can cook under 30 minutes. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We have taken a few days off to get away from our kitchen renovation and headed for Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to enjoy some sand beaches, blue water, and fresh air. Instantly I fell in love with the beauty of the Atlantic coast. I even think I would love to move there in my near future tender age 🙂 I have put together few pictures from our trip for your enjoyment! Crab cakes are a perfect dish for a summer lunch. Serve it with a glass of nice and cold white wine or mead. If you never made crab cakes no need to fear, they&#8217;re a lot easier than you think. All you need is to start with good quality crab meat. Using homemade mayonnaise is also key. Remember not to over mix your ingredients, and you&#8217;ll need to use your hands. Have fun and enjoy your summer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is quite an old-fashioned recipe but I really love it! A very simple appetizer but full of flavor. Make sure that you use fresh clams as this will provide the best result. Hard-shell and soft-shell clams range from the tiny steamers and littlenecks to the huge geoduck, whose neck may protrude several feet from its shell, and giant sea clams, which can weigh several hundred pounds. The smallest clams are the best for eating whole, usually steamed or in sauces. Bigger clams are usually tougher and best minced, then added to the sauces, chowders, and other dishes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This warm, spicy marinate with its rich partnership of flavors is a perfect complement to lightly fried fish, such as cod, bass, sea bass or tilapia. “Marinade” is a carrot-onion sauce that the fish is covered and served with. This dish can be served hot with mashed potatoes or at room temperature as an appetizer. And the good thing is &#8211; you can make it a day before serving! Try it, you&#8217;ll thank me later-) &#8220;To marinade (from Latin “marinus” – marine) is a method of cooking utilizing strong brine – marinade. First marinades have appeared in ancient Rome and were as simple as sea water used to soak meat, fish, and poultry in order to mitigate or impart other flavors. Use of seawater as first natural marinade was known to almost all “sea” peoples. In Scandinavia and Finland to the day certain caught sea fish is not only soaked but also boiled in the same water the fish lived in. Gradually, more complex marinades have developed, each with its own character and for a different product: meat, fish, mushrooms, vegetables, and fruits. In Southern Europe, with its developed winemaking, vinegar gradually has replaced salt and enabled to marinate fruits [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Authorship of this wonderful salad is attributed to Anastas Bogomilov &#8211; merchant, the owner of a network of popular canteens and restaurants in Moscow at the beginning of 20th century. During late 1910’s Russia has been going through a lot of political and social turmoil eventually manifested in two revolutions of 1917. It has been very common for patrons of his restaurants adhering to opposing political views to get drunk and get into argument about the fate of the country. Arguments eventually were growing into a fight accompanied by broken plates, glasses and even furniture. Clever businessman and patriot, Anastas came up with the idea of good hearty snack which could represent a notion of national unification. “Herring under a fur coat” has been served for the first time on New Year&#8217;s Eve of 1919. The main ingredient of this dish was herring – a favorite treat of the working poor, or “proletarians”. With the addition of onions, potatoes, and carrots, covered by a layer of grated beets symbolizing red banner of the revolutionaries the salad was a sure hit. In order not to forget the enemies of the Soviets, the salad has been generously seasoned with Western invention – [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Succulent poached salmon and eggs combined with creamy avocado, sautéed onions, and fresh basil make a substantial sandwich. The ingredients all blend together perfectly to create a gourmet-tasting experience. This sandwich takes a little work to prepare but is not short on taste. It can be served warm or chilled. How to cook a perfect hard-cooked egg: Place egg (or eggs) in a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover the egg to a depth of about 1 inch. Cover and bring water just to boiling point. Remove from heat and let stand 15-20 minutes. Cool immediately in ice water to reduce the formation of a dark ring around the yolk where the white meets the yolk. Note: Sandwiches taste best if the bread is fresh and sliced as thinly as possible. Chill an unsliced loaf of bread in refrigerator for a few hours if you want to slice it thinly, but be sure to wrap it well in waxed paper so that it will not dry out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The inspiration for this recipe came from South African cuisine, where they tent to marry fish with fruit a lot. The sweetness of the fruit is offset by the sharpness of the balsamic vinegar. This is a really light, well-balanced dish, which tastes particularly fine when served with an arugula salad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether you refer to them as crawfish, crayfish or craw-daddies, these 3 to 5-inch crustaceans, the small freshwater version of a lobster, make a perfect picnic dinner with friends when paired with cold beer. For dark beer lovers, I suggest Samuel Smith Imperial Stout &#8211; strong in taste, maybe a little overwhelming for crawfish, but still good. For girls who like something nice and soft &#8211; Italian Ale is a perfect match. Contessa Italian Pale Ale is my favorite, it is a bit fruity and very smooth. I give you my recipe for hot and juicy boiled crawfish, but you can use your imagination in adding spices or seasonings to the boiling water. People in New Orleans use everything from cayenne pepper, garlic, lemons, thyme, onions, to prepared blends of seasonings. After cooking crawfish, remove the heads from the tail section and then, grasping the crawfish behind the claws, turn them stomach side up and twist the tail section. The shell will break, and the sand vein can be pulled out easily.]]></description>
