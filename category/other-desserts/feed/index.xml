					<description><![CDATA[Using ancient flours and grains while cooking allows you to incorporate new flavors and health factors into your recipe. Flours from so long ago come with a slew of health benefits that the recipe would be missing if you had used regular flour. Teff flour, an ancient flour stemming from Ethiopia, is a gluten-free alternative that is starting to become more widely used. Teff is delicious, hearty, and packed with ancient health benefits Because teff is gluten-free, it is an incredible substitute for those with celiac disease or any other form of gluten sensitivity. Even without sensitivities to gluten, you may still find improvements in your digestion of this flour. typical gluten in a normal body creates inflammation at a low-level in your body, so the switch to a gluten-free flour may have you find unexpected relief. Another huge positive of teff flour is its natural abundance of fiber. Average teff flour can contain up to five times the amount of fiber typically found in flour, further promoting the health benefits of using teff over typical flour. The extra fiber is great for promoting digestive regularity, as well as helping to clear your digestive tract of toxins and food waste. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My kids love waffles &#8211; making them in a cast iron waffle-maker on the stove is a very unique experience. Waffles come out very crispy outside and nice and soft inside with the earthy aroma of home ground flour. When I was a child I spent a few of my summer breaks with my aunt’s family in a small Russian village. The house they lived in was made of logs, had a huge wood-burning clay oven, a barn for animals, a beautiful garden with green peas and carrots, an orchard with apple trees and of course a banya &#8211; the Russian sauna. Although I was not happy back then to spend my summers with cows and chickens, now as I look back, I can truly say that was the best time of my life and I miss the simple life in the country. I used to wake up every day smelling the aroma of freshly baked bread and other breakfast pastry my aunt baked in the morning. She got up very early at sunrise, with the rooster’s crow. She milked the cow, fed the animals and started to burn wood in the oven to warm up the house and cook the food. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Russians love to bake. My childhood home always smelled like sweet dough and we had bakes all year round. But of course fall and winter were special seasons for baking. To the day I still carry that tradition. When the weather starts to cool down and first firewood is put to use, I like to spend my time baking and creating new sweet recipes. Poppy seeds is one of the commonly used baking ingredients in Russian cuisine. Challah is my favorite type of dough, it is simple to make, it&#8217;s tasty and its texture is great. If poppy seeds are too much trouble for you, just make plain Challah wreath and top it with almonds. But I absolutely love poppy seeds here, they bring sweet crunch to this delicious dinner table centerpiece. This recipe is great for holidays and family gatherings.

					<description><![CDATA[I will always remember from time to time, when coming from school, in cold and rainy autumn and winter days, opening the door and immediately smell the baking sweets being made. My fondest memories are of my mother baking “Zavarnie Kolechki” (Choux Pastry Rings). I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy this delicate dessert from my childhood. I wonder what foods and recipes do you remember fondly from childhood, and where are you from? For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page. Elegantly light and crisp, choux pastry puffs up during baking to at least double its original size, creating a hollow center, perfect for sweet filling. Choux is one of the easiest pastries to make; follow the instructions and you can’t go wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These cinnamon buns/rolls are very special, sweet, gooey and irresistible. You fill the dough with sugary pecans, mixed with cinnamon, butter, and cocoa powder, that produces beautiful, buttery layers. These bear no resemblance to anything store-bought. &#8220;It&#8217;s spring fever. That is what the name of it is. And when you&#8217;ve got it, you want—oh, you don&#8217;t quite know what it is you do want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you want it so!”&#160;― Mark Twain]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was a child we were allowed to go by ourselves to the local food store for simple shopping such as getting bread or milk. Very often in my early age, I had basic grocery shopping as a chore. Our nearby bakery was nothing special. They stocked few varieties of bread, some breakfast pastries, as well as few cakes, were always available, but that was all. But sometimes, if you were lucky to come to the store at the right time, you could find a number of sweet treats behind the glass display. One of such treats was rum baba, soaked in sweet syrup, rum and covered with a white sugar icing. So once in a while, I used to come home from my shopping trip with an extra item. Nobody complained, of course, tea kettle was immediately put on and sweet baba was served regardless what time of the day it was. We have never baked baba at home, so I don&#8217;t have family baba recipe. Recently I have recalled some of my childhood sweet delights and decided to give rum baba a try. I used a recipe from Julia Child’s book and my baba came out just [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Scones resemble biscuits, and indeed might be considered their British cousins. They are common-place on the tea table but being inherently rebellious, people from other countries find them inviting on the breakfast table as well. Scones are simple to put together. They are generally heavier than biscuits and often are studded with fresh and dried fruits, ginger or made from nutritious oats. A hot scone eaten as the British do, with a dollop of crème fraîche or Devonshire cream and some chunky berry preserves, is a taste treat not to be missed on either side of the Atlantic. These easy-to-make, substantial strawberry scones are simply splendid in the morning with a steaming cup of coffee. Have a sweet weekend!!!]]></description>

To change things up a bit look for dried fruits that are a bit out of the ordinary, such as pineapple and mango. Having said that, these are delicious made with fat golden raisins or dried strawberries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently I had a stomach virus and I was in bed for a few days, yuck 🙁 As soon as I started feeling a bit better I started craving jello. I was dying to taste a fruity, berry or orange cool dessert and asked my husband to get me some as soon as possible. He rushed to the store and brought me four-pack of fruit jello. To tell you the truth, I do not buy things like desserts and puddings. You know me, I cook everything myself from scratch and use ingredients as natural and as organic as possible. But in the situation when you are sick and you want something, it does not matter what you get, because it has been now. I opened my jello pack and tried one teaspoon. OMG, what are they feeding us? It was so artificial, so chemical and over-sweetened, I was horrified! When I start feeling better first thing I made was homemade delicious jello with fresh juice and organic berries. What a difference! My kids were extremely happy, I have even whipped a bit of fresh cream for the top. It is simple and healthy, full of vitamins, please make it for [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hearty and robust or delicate and cake-like, all muffins have a place on the morning table.&#160;Homemade jams&#160;and preserves go well with full-flavored muffins, while the more subtle ones need only sweet butter, a little crème fraîche, or perhaps a spoonful of jelly. Some muffins filled with berries need no accompaniment at all. If you like full size, rounded muffins, disregard all the instructions you have ever read which advise you to fill the muffin cups one-half or two-thirds full. Instead, fill the cups to the brim &#8211; especially if the batter is heavy or made with whole-wheat flour. Have a wonderful weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s a dream come true, you can make your own marshmallow! In a single weekend afternoon, transform your kitchen into a sugar workshop, creating treats for yourself and, if there are children around you, ensure your lasting and unwavering popularity among them. Variation:&#160;To make a different flavor marshmallow, replace the blackberry purée with strawberry, raspberry or red currant. To make any fruit&#160;purée:&#160; Put one cup of the berries (of your choice) in a saucepan with a couple of tablespoons of sugar and heat very gently, stirring with a wooden spoon from time to time. When the mixture comes to a simmer, cook gently for another 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender or a food processor and whiz to a puree, then strain through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into a bowl. You will have extra purée, don&#8217;t worry, use for your morning pancakes or ice cream toppings)) You will need: 8&#215;8-inch pan with parchment paper, a candy thermometer, and a stand mixer]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Christmas is probably the favorite holiday for many people. And I think it&#8217;s not because of religious beliefs, but because it&#8217;s family time, and time for magic and forgiveness. Christmas is different for every one of us. Every house has its own traditions and rituals with special food and Christmas decorations. What is your perfect Christmas? How do you see it? For me, instantly come to mind Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales. I imagine a small attic room in a Danish countryside house, with a fireplace and a small Christmas tree. Beautifully wrapped presents everywhere, under the Christmas tree, inside the red stockings, and hanging from a headboard of the bed. The children are playing near the fire. A silver teapot full of aromatic tea is sitting on a table and a sweet fruit pudding is waiting to be cut onto a crystal plate. The holiday spirit is in the air and everyone is happy and joyful. Heavy snow is coming down and covering every roof, but melting very quickly around the chimneys. The house smells like nutmeg and cinnamon &#8211; just like in &#8220;The Snow Queen&#8221;, one of my favorite childhood stories. Christmas is a very extraordinary time, a [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When fall comes, what makes us want to bake so much? I wonder&#8230; Is it the changing colors on trees, or the cool evenings, or the orange pumpkins sticking out from the ground? Or the kids coming home from school and you like to surprise them with aromatic sweets? Or maybe everything together: the new beautiful season is born and you like to bring it into your home &#8211; mixing spices, honey, and chocolate. The magic of the fall makes the feeling at home even dearer. In these tasty apple-pumpkin strudel parcels, the spices and coconut oil are added for a special flavor. Bite into these crisp filled desserts to reveal a tasty fall filling. For more information about coconut oil visit: &#160;Coconut Oil For Weight Loss and Many Health Benefits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love everything about fall &#8211; from kids finally going back to school to the turning leaves and the crisp air.  Of course, I look forward to visiting various pumpkin patches, farmers markets, but mostly I&#8217;m excited to go apple picking at some of our local orchards that offer over 30 varieties of apples.  I will be reporting back on those in the next few weeks, but to help you get you in the Autumn mood right now, I have highlighted some of my favorites fall recipes. So if you&#8217;re like me, I hope you will get inspired by the autumns&#8217; seasonal ingredients, and cook up one of the dishes I have rounded up here: Apple Torte with Cranberries and Raisins Apple Strudel Limoncello Apple Fritters Apple and Honey Madeleines Apple, Lemon Cake with Hazelnuts Apple Dumplings Stuffed with Dry Fruits and served with Homemade Caramel Sauce]]></description>
