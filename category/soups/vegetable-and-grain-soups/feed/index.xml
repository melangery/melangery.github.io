					<description><![CDATA[This is a hearty soup that captures the flavor of the Chicken of the woods. It goes best with a full-bodied Zinfandel for a midday lunch! Laetiporus sulphureous known as Chicken-of-the-Woods The common name of this a fungus derives from the fact that, when cooked, this mushroom has the texture of fresh chicken breast. The fungus is one of a larger group of fungi known as polypores &#8211; similar to boletes in that the underside of the cap is composed of pores rather than gills. In most cases polyphonies are inedible because of their woody texture. Some, however, are quite good to eat, and the chicken of the woods is among the best known. It is also known as the sulfur mushroom because the underside of the cap is a bright yellow color. The top side is red-orange, which makes it very easy to identify. These fungi can be seen growing out of fallen and rotting trees from summer to late fall. Older specimens take a long time to cook because of their woody texture. Younger specimens take just a short time to make them soft and chewable. The part of the fungus farthest from the base is the most [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As the weather turns colder and fall steps in, &#8220;cold weather soups&#8221; are an indispensable part of the menu. I would like to share with you one of my favorites &#8211; buckwheat soup!&#160;It is filling, super healthy and delicious. When it is raining or freezing outside, what else is better than to snuggle on the couch in your PJs, with a warm blanket, good book or film and a huge bowl of warm yummy soup? For me personally, soups are good in any weather &#8211; &#160;lentil soup, chicken soup, potato carrot, and definitely buckwheat soup are on my &#8220;short list&#8221;. But first &#8211; a little story. Today is a very special Russian Monday. One week ago, I was visiting my dear friends in Winter Park, Florida. They are also huge fans of my blog and my fine art photography. And it happened to be that Russian Monday is their favorite chapter on my blog. One thing leads to another and we found ourselves cooking Russian food for sixteen people for Monday evening. The menu was simple but creative. Our starters were roasted marrow bones with pickled onions, small sandwiches with&#160;fish, caviar, and vegetables, potato salad &#8220;Olivier&#8221;, and amazing cheese tray [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With its sweet, earthy taste, butternut squash soup with apples and ginger is my favorite for the month of October. I like to play with spices when I am cooking pumpkin soup, but you can use your favorite seasonings and herbs. The roasted carrot chips are a perfect addition to this soup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s been a while since my last post and I truly missed my blog and my dear readers. My new kitchen is finally finished; summer vacations are behind us, so I can slowly come back to my real life with cooking, photographing and sharing recipes. My first recipe after a long break is wild mushroom soup, creamy and earthy, just the way it should be. Please scroll down for the recipe, because first, I have shared with you some impressions from my last voyage. The Food Blog Forum this year took place in a gorgeous town of Asheville, North Carolina. I have never been there before and I am glad that we made a decision to take a long drive to attend this conference. It was three days of learning and sharing experience, meeting new people and tasting food (lots and lots of delicious food). I loved every minute of it; this was the best one yet! The opening welcome party has been provided by Doubletree&#160;Asheville-Biltmore on the beautiful garden terrace. We enjoyed unique appetizers with peach and watermelon moonshine cocktails (featuring local artisan distiller Troy &#38; Sons). We left with goodie bags from&#160;Foodtopia Asheville. Next day we have gathered [&#8230;]]]></description>

Serve this rustic, vegetarian soup before a salad or other light main course. It goes well with whole-wheat bread. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mushroom and barley soup is one of my favorite soups since childhood. The only difference between now and then is that years ago the soup had to be made from dried mushrooms. Back then in Russia it was not possible to buy a lot of fresh food during winter time, especially mushrooms. Summer was a busy season for making jams, picking wild berries and mushrooms in a forests. However, to be used throughout the year these had to be dried and frozen. Only the best mushrooms (porcini mushrooms or the like) were used for drying. They were carefully selected, cleaned and hanged on the thread somewhere in the dry and warm corner of the kitchen. There could never be a lot of mushrooms, so the soup was made on special occasions. It was the best soup that I ever had, full of aroma complemented by nice texture of barley. My mom always used to add potatoes to the soup, but I like to cook it without potatoes. Now dried wild mushrooms are expensive, so I use fresh mushrooms and cook this soup very often. But still every time it reminds me of my early days at home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Roasted Butternut Squash Bisque with Almonds is a fragrant, creamy and delicately flavored soup. I hope you will enjoy this soup as well as we are. Note: Freezing pumpkin. It is easy to enjoy pumping recipes year-round, but you must do some freezing. Clean and peel the pumpkin and cut into large pieces, about 4 inches square. Blanch in boiling water that contains the juice of a lemon and 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil, for about 4 minutes. Drain and cool the pieces; seal in plastic bags and freeze. Then you will be ready for some great early traditional dishes all year. If you wish to prepare mashed pumpkin for freezing, do so without hesitation. Clean and peel the pumpkin pieces and steam until very tender. Run them through your food processor and put in plastic freezing containers. Squeeze a little fresh lemon juice on top to prevent browning in the freezer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Asparagus is part of a springtime triumvirate, joining sweet peas and fresh mint as a cherished sign of the season. Pea Shoots &#38; Asparagus spring soup can be served hot or cold. Lemon zest is a tasty flavor accent with asparagus. I ladle the soup into small cups for a refreshing start to a meal. Pea shoots are a real find for a kitchen maestro. These are leaves on traditional garden pea plant which can be harvested every couple of weeks, they are tender and full of flavor. Try to replace with them your traditional salad greens or add some to your soups and be surprised! This beautiful purple asparagus came from our community garden, very sweet and flavorful. This soup is so simple &#8211; in terms of ingredients and preparation. It would provide an elegant start to a dinner party.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The spring is here, I can feel it! The birds are singing and the air is so fresh. I love the early mornings when I come down to my patio to check out the weather and I can feel how the earth is waking up after a long sleep. But before we all dive into yellow colors, Easter eggs and pink flowers I would like to say goodbye to the winter, to those cold days when we were sharing great food with our dear friends by the fireplace, to winter holidays and to snowflakes (we had snow only 3 times this winter), and many more unforgettable moments of the past season. We had a long walk with my daughter in Taylor Park on a beautiful sunny and warm day, and yet the presence of winter is still here. We are in the middle of season change and I love the times when winter is holding hands with spring. Very soon we are going to plan spring menus with greens and berries, salads and chilled soups, but before that, I would like to share with you one more dish which represents to me an essence of the passed cold days &#8211; [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A good mushroom soup makes the most of the subtle and sometimes rather elusive flavor of mushrooms. white mushrooms are used here for there pale color; cremini or, better still, portabello mushrooms give a fuller flavor but turn the soup dark brown. Mushroom, Leek with Yellow Cauliflower Soup is a delicious and nutritious soup, which should be served with crusty bread.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may substitute any fresh herb for a Parsley Sauce. Other dried mushrooms can also be used, but none will give the intensity of porcini. You will simply have a milder flavored soup. When buying mushrooms leveled &#8220;cepes&#8221; or &#8220;porcini&#8221;, let your nose lead you. The mushrooms should have a rich, woodsy character with overtones of leather. Dried ceps or porcini are very easy to use. Just pop them into a long-cooking stew and let them cast their magic. Or cover the mushrooms with water, bring to boil, simmer them, and watch the liquid become black with richness. Use that liquid as the base of a soup or sauce. This will make the liquid much more flavorful. Remember, the magic is in the liquid, not the reconstituted mushroom. The recipe from A Cook&#8217;s Book of Mushrooms]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;He who controls the spice controls the universe. Such were the words uttered by the main character of the movie Dune based on the Frank Herbert science fiction epic of the same name. In the story, the spice was the lifeblood of a vast empire. For the leaders of this empire, it was essential that at all times the spice must flow. The spice trade of the Dune movie was no doubt inspired by the historical trade in aromatics from ancient times to the present. At various periods in history, spices have been as valuable as gold and silver. According to a 15th century saying: No man should die who can afford cinnamon.&#8221; I love to cook with spices lately. Here is a perfect lunch or dinner, full of exotic ingredients and yet healthy, vegetarian dishes.]]></description>

CORIANDER For Good Boys and Girls from The Spice Cookbook 1964 &#8220;Trough your current spice shelf may not include coriander, it may soon become part of your repertory of spices.

But once the hard sugar shell is penetrated, there is the treasured seed.Coriander is another of that timeless meat-magic-and-medicine, good-for-man-or-beast spices whose history stems from the earliest times. With the rise of civilization the coriander plant, native to the Mediterranean, developed into a product of worldwide trade.
