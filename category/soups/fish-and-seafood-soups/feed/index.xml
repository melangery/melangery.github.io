					<description><![CDATA[Nowadays, we think of oysters as a luxury food, but a few centuries ago they where in such bountiful and accessible supply that people actually complained of having to eat too many. Too many oysters &#8211; can you imagine? Today is the Orthodox Christmas day. Marry Christmas to all who celebrates it on this day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Luxurious Lobster Bisque &#38; Other Unique Lobster Recipes That Are a Must Try This Summer Are you looking for a dinner that isn&#8217;t just the same beef, pork, or chicken dish? Maybe you&#8217;re planning to cook a fancy dinner for you and your significant other. Lobster is a great way to take your dinner plans to the next level. But rather than going with the typical lobster tail and butter, why not consider one of the following recipes? Grilled Lobster Mango Tango This recipe is more involved than the first, but if you want something unique, it&#8217;s a great option. To make this lobster dish, you&#8217;ll need to prepare a Moho Cubaneau sauce and a mango vinaigrette dressing. Other ingredients include mesclun salad greens, oranges, limes, mango, Asian chili paste, and of course, lobster. It&#8217;s a great Latin dish that will titillate the senses. Lobster Ravioli With Brown Sauce If you&#8217;re willing to put forth the effort, lobster ravioli is an elegant dish that will impress your sweetheart or whomever you make it for. (Here&#8217;s a great tip; using wonton wrappers instead of homemade ravioli is a smart way to save time when preparing ravioli!) Fresh ingredients are really what make this [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“Ukha” is a Russian word used to name fish broth or fish soup. In this meaning, it exists in the language for about 250 years or so, but before it was used for any fish or meat-based soup, pea soup or sometimes even sweet soup served with sugar. In the dictionary “Lexicon” published in 1704, “ukha” is defined as a synonym for “gravy”. There were three main kinds of “ukha” (soup): a white one with onions, yellow – with saffron and black one – with pepper, cinnamon, and cloves. During feasts and wedding receptions few different types of “ukha” were served accompanied by pirogues with various stuffing. This tradition exists to the day, except that variety of pirogues is much more limited. With time soups with noodles, cereals, etc. have gotten their own names and word “ukha” started being used only for fish soup or both cooked without grains. Recipe of 18th century describes the following sequence of steps: “The fish should be gutted, cut in pieces and placed in a pot. Caviar and milt should be put on top of the fish. Pour water or fish broth made from small fish, add dill, parsnip, lemon, pepper, and flour. Cook [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I picked this recipe up on holiday in Main and was inspired to make my version of it. I hope you enjoy making it for family and friends &#8211; it&#8217;s superb for Sunday lunch. Cod used to be considered a cheap option, but it has been overfished and is now relatively scarce and a lot more expensive. It is a succulent fish with white flaky flesh and lends itself to most cooking methods.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MINT Symbol of Hospitality from The Spice Cookbook, 1964 &#8220;One of Ovid&#8217;s tales of godsend goddesses, written years ago, was inspired by mint-symbol of hospitality. Philemon and Baucis, man and wife, were living in Phrygia, a country in Asia Minor. The land was so poor, this couple had scarcely sufficient food to keep them alive. One day two strangers knocked at their door, asking to be fed. Despite their poverty, Philemon and Baucis were delighted to have guests and prepared the best meal possible from their meager supplies. Wanting to fill their humble home with an inviting fragrance, they rubbed their table with mint leaves. At that point their anxieties were passed &#8211; the guests proved to be Zeus and Hermes, incognito. The hovel was soon transformed into a temple, and priests ministered to all the needs of Philemon and Baucis for the duration of their lives. Mint, plant historians claim, came originally from the Mediterranean shores. Mythology offers a far more romantic story: mint was once the nymph Mentha, unfortunate to have attracted the eye of Pluto. Persephone, his jealous wife, pursued Mentha and trod her ferociously underfoot. Pluto, unable to control his wife&#8217;s fury, changed Mentha into a [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In our home, we love salmon soups. I have already two recipes here; it’s Salmon Vegetable Soup with Barley and Coho Salmon and Autumn Vegetables Soup with Turmeric. If there is a more perfect fish soup than this one, I cannot think of it at the moment. Succulent pink salmon in a clear broth with rice and seaweed seasoned with the white vine and served with a lemon slice and fresh dill. Some facts about salmon: Oily fish as salmon are generally very popular as they are healthy and readily available. Salmon is good for the brain and great at helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes; it can also help make your skin look younger. Salmon is a great source of protein, rich in magnesium, zinc, selenium, and vitamin A, plus B vitamins, and – most importantly it is a good source of omega3 fatty acids, with making the bloodless “sticky,” thus helping to reduce the risk of blood clots that could cause heart attacks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In all the branches of cookery, I don&#8217;t think there is anything more fun than making soups. Because the flavor builds up gradually as the elements cook together and blend, it is usually a fairly slow process, but one which leaves room for much experimentation and invention. You must taste as you go along and probably will want to correct the seasoning with a touch or two of your own. I love making soups, it&#8217;s like making a magic potion, stirring, mixing, adding different herbs and spices, tasting, stirring again. My daughter loves watching me cooking soups, she is always saying: &#8220;Look, mommy is doing her magic again&#8221; and I always smile. 🙂 Salmon soup was created especially for my kids; they are picky eaters but they like soups. Wild Salmon and barley &#8211; it is the symbol to me how the ocean meets the earth &#8211; balanced and harmonious. The softness of vegetables and texture of barley are a delicious combination. I hope you like it too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, (from the Russian кижуч kizhuch) is a species of anadromous fish in the salmon family. Coho salmon are also known as silver salmon or &#8220;silvers&#8221;.Ocean caught coho is regarded as excellent table fare. It has a moderate to the high amount of fat, which is considered essential when judging taste. Only Spring Chinook and Sockeye salmon have higher levels of fats in their meat.From Wikipedia]]></description>
