					<description><![CDATA[This is a hearty soup that captures the flavor of the Chicken of the woods. It goes best with a full-bodied Zinfandel for a midday lunch! Laetiporus sulphureous known as Chicken-of-the-Woods The common name of this a fungus derives from the fact that, when cooked, this mushroom has the texture of fresh chicken breast. The fungus is one of a larger group of fungi known as polypores &#8211; similar to boletes in that the underside of the cap is composed of pores rather than gills. In most cases polyphonies are inedible because of their woody texture. Some, however, are quite good to eat, and the chicken of the woods is among the best known. It is also known as the sulfur mushroom because the underside of the cap is a bright yellow color. The top side is red-orange, which makes it very easy to identify. These fungi can be seen growing out of fallen and rotting trees from summer to late fall. Older specimens take a long time to cook because of their woody texture. Younger specimens take just a short time to make them soft and chewable. The part of the fungus farthest from the base is the most [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Importance of the soup stock: The most delicious soups are those that begin with a stock. Not only is flavor enhanced but the broth takes on added nutritional value. From the basic broth, diverse soups can be created with the addition of other meats and vegetables. Flavor is imparted automatically through the simmering process, but to extract the maximum nutrition there are a few rules that must be carefully followed. Save bits of raw vegetables, tops of scallions and celery, tender leaves of beets, tough spinach, stems of watercress and dill, limp outer leaves of lettuce &#8211; in other words, all of the otherwise good foodstuffs you normally trow away because they are not esthetically pleasing or simply because you are accustomed to treating them as scraps. These should be well washed and refrigerated in a large jar with a lid. They can be kept up to ten days. Freeze scraps of leftover meat in plastic containers. Meat bones and the carcasses of game birds, chickens, turkeys, or ducks may also be frozen for use in soup stocks. If poultry has been stuffed, carefully remove any remaining bits from the carcass before freezing.The only vegetables you will not save are [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As the weather turns colder and fall steps in, &#8220;cold weather soups&#8221; are an indispensable part of the menu. I would like to share with you one of my favorites &#8211; buckwheat soup!&#160;It is filling, super healthy and delicious. When it is raining or freezing outside, what else is better than to snuggle on the couch in your PJs, with a warm blanket, good book or film and a huge bowl of warm yummy soup? For me personally, soups are good in any weather &#8211; &#160;lentil soup, chicken soup, potato carrot, and definitely buckwheat soup are on my &#8220;short list&#8221;. But first &#8211; a little story. Today is a very special Russian Monday. One week ago, I was visiting my dear friends in Winter Park, Florida. They are also huge fans of my blog and my fine art photography. And it happened to be that Russian Monday is their favorite chapter on my blog. One thing leads to another and we found ourselves cooking Russian food for sixteen people for Monday evening. The menu was simple but creative. Our starters were roasted marrow bones with pickled onions, small sandwiches with&#160;fish, caviar, and vegetables, potato salad &#8220;Olivier&#8221;, and amazing cheese tray [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recall this soup from my childhood, my school and even kindergarten years. Pea soup is very rich, fragrant and delicious. It is also very good in cold weather. The cooking of it is quite simple and fast. 20-25 years ago you could get peas at any store in Russia in few varieties – yellow, green, whole or halves. The halves were especially popular for some reason, they were cheap and in demand. Pea soup in Germany is practically a national dish and usually is served with smoked pork. Similarly, in Netherlands pea soup is cooked from crushed green peas with pork. Russian version of this soup is cooked with potatoes and served with crackers or toast. This recipe is my grandma’s – she used to make pea soup with smoked ribs and served it with garlic croutons made in the oven. Fantastically delicious!

					<description><![CDATA[Nowadays, we think of oysters as a luxury food, but a few centuries ago they where in such bountiful and accessible supply that people actually complained of having to eat too many. Too many oysters &#8211; can you imagine? Today is the Orthodox Christmas day. Marry Christmas to all who celebrates it on this day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With great pleasure I am happy to introduce you to one of my favorite soups – pickled soup (or “rassolnik” in Russian). This is traditional soup of peasants and farmers, people working the land &#8211; hearty, tasty and cheap to cook. Today’s “rassolnik” is direct descendant of picked dishes of traditional Russian cuisine, some of which  included pirogue with stuffing soaked in cucumber or any other spicy brine. Four main varieties of “rassolnik” are made either with meat, fish, vegetable or giblets broth and pickles is mandatory ingredient in all of these varieties. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Luxurious Lobster Bisque &#38; Other Unique Lobster Recipes That Are a Must Try This Summer Are you looking for a dinner that isn&#8217;t just the same beef, pork, or chicken dish? Maybe you&#8217;re planning to cook a fancy dinner for you and your significant other. Lobster is a great way to take your dinner plans to the next level. But rather than going with the typical lobster tail and butter, why not consider one of the following recipes? Grilled Lobster Mango Tango This recipe is more involved than the first, but if you want something unique, it&#8217;s a great option. To make this lobster dish, you&#8217;ll need to prepare a Moho Cubaneau sauce and a mango vinaigrette dressing. Other ingredients include mesclun salad greens, oranges, limes, mango, Asian chili paste, and of course, lobster. It&#8217;s a great Latin dish that will titillate the senses. Lobster Ravioli With Brown Sauce If you&#8217;re willing to put forth the effort, lobster ravioli is an elegant dish that will impress your sweetheart or whomever you make it for. (Here&#8217;s a great tip; using wonton wrappers instead of homemade ravioli is a smart way to save time when preparing ravioli!) Fresh ingredients are really what make this [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anyone who ever lived in Russia or Ukraine knows what Borscht is. It is very famous and favorite soup of many. There is a good number of different Borsht recipes in the world and I also have a few on my blog: Vegetarian Borscht, Chilled Borscht, Beet Soup with Sweet Potato, Borscht with Turkey Meatballs &#8211; just take your pick. Every time I cook this soup, I make it differently. This time I made Borsht with chicken broth and soft boil egg. I served it with a lot of fresh herbs and toasts. I cooked it yesterday for lunch, and my whole family were fed from one pot. Have a delicious Monday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is very simple everyday soup, it took me no more than 20 minutes to make it. This time I used all organic ingredients as well as grass-fed ground beef. Healthy food for an after-school meal. My kids loved it! OREGANO from The Spice Cookbook, 1964 Oregano is native to the hillsides of the Mediterranean region and is a perennial of the mint family. The name origanum, derived from the Greek ours, meaning mountain, and ganus, meaning joy, thus signified &#8220;joy of the mountain&#8221; to the Greeks 2000 years ago. It grew easily then, as it still does in Greece, Italy, and Spain. In ancient times oregano was valued as much for its medicinal qualities as its savory flavor. The Roman naturalist, Pliny the Elder, prescribed it as a cure for indigestion and first aid for spider and scorpion stings. In the Medieval Ages, physicians used a mixture of oregano and other herbs to &#8220;cleanse the brain&#8221; and improve sight. While Culpeper thought highly of oregano as a digestive, soothing to jittery nerves, and as a treatment for &#8220;the bites of venomous beasts,&#8221; he was in accord with modern cooks when he wrote, &#8220;There is scarcely a better herb growing [&#8230;]]]></description>

My new kitchen is finally finished; summer vacations are behind us, so I can slowly come back to my real life with cooking, photographing and sharing recipes. My first recipe after a long break is wild mushroom soup, creamy and earthy, just the way it should be. Please scroll down for the recipe, because first, I have shared with you some impressions from my last voyage. The Food Blog Forum this year took place in a gorgeous town of Asheville, North Carolina. I have never been there before and I am glad that we made a decision to take a long drive to attend this conference. It was three days of learning and sharing experience, meeting new people and tasting food (lots and lots of delicious food). I loved every minute of it; this was the best one yet! The opening welcome party has been provided by Doubletree&#160;Asheville-Biltmore on the beautiful garden terrace. We enjoyed unique appetizers with peach and watermelon moonshine cocktails (featuring local artisan distiller Troy &#38; Sons). We left with goodie bags from&#160;Foodtopia Asheville. Next day we have gathered [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beet is the main ingredient of this vegetarian borscht, and its flavor and color dominate this well-known soup. It is a classic of both Russia and Poland. Serve this rustic, vegetarian soup before a salad or other light main course. It goes well with whole-wheat bread. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This winter has been so long with a lot of snow and cold nasty winds. Sometimes snow turned into rain which froze and turned back into the snow. I don&#8217;t mind winter and I love snow days when fluffs are falling and covers trees and roofs of our houses. Snow days mean no school for kids and many cups of hot cocoa by the fireplace. But this winter was too cold and too unpleasant and I am tired of it. I need spring badly and I miss long walks in a park with my lovely daughter. Where are those yellow flowers you can see in March? Where are green leaves? Today was the first day of nice warm weather. I was walking around without my winter jacket and the birds were singing welcoming the first sunshine. I had a lovely strawberry soup on my patio and I thought soon, very soon the earth will be waking up from a long sleep. Strawberry tapioca soup is a deliciously refreshing fruit soup, just right for a warm spring day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mushroom and barley soup is one of my favorite soups since childhood. The only difference between now and then is that years ago the soup had to be made from dried mushrooms. Back then in Russia it was not possible to buy a lot of fresh food during winter time, especially mushrooms. Summer was a busy season for making jams, picking wild berries and mushrooms in a forests. However, to be used throughout the year these had to be dried and frozen. Only the best mushrooms (porcini mushrooms or the like) were used for drying. They were carefully selected, cleaned and hanged on the thread somewhere in the dry and warm corner of the kitchen. There could never be a lot of mushrooms, so the soup was made on special occasions. It was the best soup that I ever had, full of aroma complemented by nice texture of barley. My mom always used to add potatoes to the soup, but I like to cook it without potatoes. Now dried wild mushrooms are expensive, so I use fresh mushrooms and cook this soup very often. But still every time it reminds me of my early days at home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This Russian soup made with lamb, and it&#8217;s substantial and warming &#8211; just perfect for taking the edge off a hearty appetite on a cold winter&#8217;s day. Lamb and garbanzo beans go together so well, they seem to have been made for one another. Thick slices of warm rustic bread would make the perfect accompaniment.]]></description>
