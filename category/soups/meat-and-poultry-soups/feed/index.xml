					<description><![CDATA[Importance of the soup stock: The most delicious soups are those that begin with a stock. Not only is flavor enhanced but the broth takes on added nutritional value. From the basic broth, diverse soups can be created with the addition of other meats and vegetables. Flavor is imparted automatically through the simmering process, but to extract the maximum nutrition there are a few rules that must be carefully followed. Save bits of raw vegetables, tops of scallions and celery, tender leaves of beets, tough spinach, stems of watercress and dill, limp outer leaves of lettuce &#8211; in other words, all of the otherwise good foodstuffs you normally trow away because they are not esthetically pleasing or simply because you are accustomed to treating them as scraps. These should be well washed and refrigerated in a large jar with a lid. They can be kept up to ten days. Freeze scraps of leftover meat in plastic containers. Meat bones and the carcasses of game birds, chickens, turkeys, or ducks may also be frozen for use in soup stocks. If poultry has been stuffed, carefully remove any remaining bits from the carcass before freezing.The only vegetables you will not save are [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recall this soup from my childhood, my school and even kindergarten years. Pea soup is very rich, fragrant and delicious. It is also very good in cold weather. The cooking of it is quite simple and fast. 20-25 years ago you could get peas at any store in Russia in few varieties – yellow, green, whole or halves. The halves were especially popular for some reason, they were cheap and in demand. Pea soup in Germany is practically a national dish and usually is served with smoked pork. Similarly, in Netherlands pea soup is cooked from crushed green peas with pork. Russian version of this soup is cooked with potatoes and served with crackers or toast. This recipe is my grandma’s – she used to make pea soup with smoked ribs and served it with garlic croutons made in the oven. Fantastically delicious!

					<description><![CDATA[With great pleasure I am happy to introduce you to one of my favorite soups – pickled soup (or “rassolnik” in Russian). This is traditional soup of peasants and farmers, people working the land &#8211; hearty, tasty and cheap to cook. Today’s “rassolnik” is direct descendant of picked dishes of traditional Russian cuisine, some of which  included pirogue with stuffing soaked in cucumber or any other spicy brine. Four main varieties of “rassolnik” are made either with meat, fish, vegetable or giblets broth and pickles is mandatory ingredient in all of these varieties. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anyone who ever lived in Russia or Ukraine knows what Borscht is. It is very famous and favorite soup of many. There is a good number of different Borsht recipes in the world and I also have a few on my blog: Vegetarian Borscht, Chilled Borscht, Beet Soup with Sweet Potato, Borscht with Turkey Meatballs &#8211; just take your pick. Every time I cook this soup, I make it differently. This time I made Borsht with chicken broth and soft boil egg. I served it with a lot of fresh herbs and toasts. I cooked it yesterday for lunch, and my whole family were fed from one pot. Have a delicious Monday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is very simple everyday soup, it took me no more than 20 minutes to make it. This time I used all organic ingredients as well as grass-fed ground beef. Healthy food for an after-school meal. My kids loved it! OREGANO from The Spice Cookbook, 1964 Oregano is native to the hillsides of the Mediterranean region and is a perennial of the mint family. The name origanum, derived from the Greek ours, meaning mountain, and ganus, meaning joy, thus signified &#8220;joy of the mountain&#8221; to the Greeks 2000 years ago. It grew easily then, as it still does in Greece, Italy, and Spain. In ancient times oregano was valued as much for its medicinal qualities as its savory flavor. The Roman naturalist, Pliny the Elder, prescribed it as a cure for indigestion and first aid for spider and scorpion stings. In the Medieval Ages, physicians used a mixture of oregano and other herbs to &#8220;cleanse the brain&#8221; and improve sight. While Culpeper thought highly of oregano as a digestive, soothing to jittery nerves, and as a treatment for &#8220;the bites of venomous beasts,&#8221; he was in accord with modern cooks when he wrote, &#8220;There is scarcely a better herb growing [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In our time the turkey is generally served on holidays, and I think this practice is very wise. The meat is lean, low in fat, high in protein, delicious in flavor, and terrible versatile. You are probably just as good as I am at thinking up ways to use leftovers, but I really do like this simple but flavorful solution to using turkey &#8220;again.&#8221;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is the better way to persuade picky children or uneasy adults to eat a healthy portion of vegetables than to make a superb soup? Tomato soup is an old favorite, but it can be made special by the addition of fresh parsley and parmesan cheese. Sweet tender carrots find their moment of glory in this scrumptious dish. The deliciously smooth texture of the soup and rustic meatballs makes it very desirable. My kids are growing older, smarter and wiser every year. I pack their lunches every morning and add small surprises like fun shaped fruits or little boxes with creative food. My seven years old son is always asking me what I put in his lunch box. &#160;His older sister tells him: &#8220;No, don&#8217;t ask, it’s like Christmas present. You will find out what is in lunchbox at school!&#8221; 🙂 How sweet it is! Children have a very strong opinion about the food they eat. When we go out to eat our daughter and son know exactly what to order. And most of the time it is from the regular menu, not a kids one. Every Friday we have a nice dinner at our house because it&#8217;s the end [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Solyanka (pronounced “so-lyan-ka”), a Russian word which can be translated as “grab-bag” or “hodgepodge” is the name of the dish symbolic in Russian cuisine known far beyond Russia. As a matter of fact, knowing the name of this dish is enough never to go hungry if you are a foreigner visiting Russia. For the first time “solyanka” is mentioned in the Russian literature of the 15th century and by the 18th century it is widespread and referred by two names – “solyanka” and “pohmelka” (“pokh-mel-ka”), which meant a greasy and very hearty soup served as snack with vodka or served as an entrée. Nobility, however, did not accept this dish at all, considering it a sign of bad taste and only commoners and poor people loved it since it was very filling and warming while being a good source to replenish energy after a whole day of hard labor. Solyanka also helped common people to drink without actually getting drunk. Solyanka can be thick or liquid. It is based on strong broths such as meat, fish or mushroom ones. Often it may contain smoked meats, franks, sausages or other sausage products. There are a lot of solyanka recipes but their [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This warming soup brings the summery flavor of basil to mid-autumn meals. Russian “kletsky” (pronounced as “klet-skee”) is a word used to name the dish known also in Ukrainian and Belarusian cuisines as “galushky”, in Italian cuisine as gnocchi, in Czech &#8211; as “knedliky” and so on. All of these dishes are flour made balls (sometimes also flattened into pillow shape) can be generally referred as dumplings. Usually cooked in broth or milk they are popular in Eastern Europe. In Belarus and Poland they are often served with lean meatless soup or sometimes fried with onion and bacon. The main secret of dumplings is tasty broth and properly cooked dough. Soups can include combination of meatballs and flour or potato dumplings. Autumn Collection: Still life with Green Pumpkins Fall is already out there and I am happy to share with you my first autumn still life composition from the new collection. I would be excited to receive your feedback. &#8220;There is something in the autumn that is native to my blood &#8211; Touch of manner, hint of mood; And my heart is like a rhyme, With the yellow and the purple and the crimson keeping time.&#8221; Bliss Carman, A Vagabond [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last Sunday, at bloggers conference in Orlando, when people were finding out I was born in Russia they have been asking if I have any recipes of Russian cuisine on my blog. Apparently, I had none. I just thought that on the internet there are plenty of recipes of cabbage soup (pronounced as “sch-ee”), cabbage rolls (“go-lub-tsy”) and perogys (“pee-ro-gee”). There are tons of these things around I would not dare to say final products look really attractive. On the way home I have been thinking about all of this, about my hometown of St. Petersburg, about my mom’s home cooking and the fact that I have graduated from the Culinary Arts Institute years ago particularly in my hometown and not at any other place. I would love to stay close to my roots and I feel that my cultural background comes out anyways in all of my creations – recipes, photos, and illustrations. My blog is a collection of all kinds of recipes, images of beautifully served dishes, and the main purpose&#160;is to serve as a source of inspiration for anyone interested in the culture of cooking and serving food. I have decided to start a new section dedicated [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recently I have come across works of fantastic illustrator Norman Rockwell who is a very talented artist from New York. I could not help to buy some of his prints. I love book illustrations and have tons of vintage cookbooks with amazing pictures. They have so many details and flavors &#8211; I can peer at them for hours, there is something so homey in them&#8230; And often I just get an urge to go and cook something, even something very simple, but just to make everyone around happy. This is the story behind this post and the Turkey Meatballs Soup with Quinoa recipe. During long cold winter evenings, a bowl of this soup can not only warm up your body but make your heart melt. Making this soup is simplicity itself, yet the flavor suggests it is the product of painstaking preparation and complicated cooking. &#8220;Without thinking too much about it in specific terms, I was showing America I knew and observed to others who might not have noticed.&#8221; —Norman Rockwell]]></description>
