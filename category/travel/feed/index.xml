					<description><![CDATA[I had some lovely time with my dear friends and clients in Winter Park, Florida at the beginning of September. My photography exhibition was taking place at AXIOM gallery while I visited Jeff and Bryan (the owners of The Ancient Olive store) at the same time. They were the first people who loved my still life art photography and we have worked together on branding for their stores. I was so happy to see their shopping bags, business cards and company stationery beautified by my art. Jeffrey and Bryan are very dear to me and finally, we got to meet and spend some time together. There is so much to do in Winter Park, but the town‚Äôs most attractive place is their store. The Ancient Olive carries a boutique assortment of amazing cheeses, jams, mustards, sauces, oils, and vinegar. The store itself is absolutely lovely and that extends to the people who work there. I have tasted many delicious gourmet foods my only regret was having an only small suitcase with me üòä Regardless, my family was happy with the gifts from the shop, the only problem &#8211; it was all gone in no time-)) I have created this recipe [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As the weather turns colder and fall steps in, &#8220;cold weather soups&#8221; are an indispensable part of the menu. I would like to share with you one of my favorites &#8211; buckwheat soup!&#160;It is filling, super healthy and delicious. When it is raining or freezing outside, what else is better than to snuggle on the couch in your PJs, with a warm blanket, good book or film and a huge bowl of warm yummy soup? For me personally, soups are good in any weather &#8211; &#160;lentil soup, chicken soup, potato carrot, and definitely buckwheat soup are on my &#8220;short list&#8221;. But first &#8211; a little story. Today is a very special Russian Monday. One week ago, I was visiting my dear friends in Winter Park, Florida. They are also huge fans of my blog and my fine art photography. And it happened to be that Russian Monday is their favorite chapter on my blog. One thing leads to another and we found ourselves cooking Russian food for sixteen people for Monday evening. The menu was simple but creative. Our starters were roasted marrow bones with pickled onions, small sandwiches with&#160;fish, caviar, and vegetables, potato salad &#8220;Olivier&#8221;, and amazing cheese tray [&#8230;]]]></description>
