					<description><![CDATA[“Maslenitsa” is a Russian carnival week originating from pre-Christian times. It was celebrated around spring solstice and was dedicated to the boy-Sun named Xors becoming a man-Sun named Yarilo. The main dish of the holiday week are pancakes (or “blini” in Russian) in all their varieties. Their round shape symbolizes the Sun. Later on, after Christianity came to Russia, the holidays fell on the Great Lent, hence the decision was made to move the celebration right before the fasting. During Maslenitsa, older people were using a chance to share their wisdom with the youth by puzzling them with this riddle: “Maslenitsa is forty Grandmothers granddaughter, thirty Brothers sister, three mothers and one father&#8217;s daughter.” The answer to this riddle was an explanation of the sacred knowledge of the structure of the universe the elders believed in. For more information about &#8220;Maslenitsa&#8221; you can read here and here. My new still life &#8220;Long Winter&#8221;- prints are available for sale. Swedish magazine &#8220;La Prestige&#8221; has published my interview in their February issue. They have included 6 pages of Russian cuisine recipes from my &#8220;Russian Monday&#8221; collection featuring my photography. I am very happy to bring this information to my readers in Europe and everywhere else in the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Russians love to bake. My childhood home always smelled like sweet dough and we had bakes all year round. But of course fall and winter were special seasons for baking. To the day I still carry that tradition. When the weather starts to cool down and first firewood is put to use, I like to spend my time baking and creating new sweet recipes. Poppy seeds is one of the commonly used baking ingredients in Russian cuisine. Challah is my favorite type of dough, it is simple to make, it&#8217;s tasty and its texture is great. If poppy seeds are too much trouble for you, just make plain Challah wreath and top it with almonds. But I absolutely love poppy seeds here, they bring sweet crunch to this delicious dinner table centerpiece. This recipe is great for holidays and family gatherings. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will always remember from time to time, when coming from school, in cold and rainy autumn and winter days, opening the door and immediately smell the baking sweets being made. My fondest memories are of my mother baking “Zavarnie Kolechki” (Choux Pastry Rings). I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy this delicate dessert from my childhood. I wonder what foods and recipes do you remember fondly from childhood, and where are you from? For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page. Elegantly light and crisp, choux pastry puffs up during baking to at least double its original size, creating a hollow center, perfect for sweet filling. Choux is one of the easiest pastries to make; follow the instructions and you can’t go wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“Lazy” dumplings (or “le-nee-vye va-re-nee-kee” in Russian) are gnocchi-shaped dumplings made by mixing ricotta cheese or farmer cheese with egg and white/wheat flour into a quick dough. It is an easier version for people who don&#8217;t have time to make stuffed dumplings. These are great for breakfast and my mom used to make them for me many times. They can be served in many ways, for example &#8211; with sweet sauce, berries, and cream. If you like to have a savory version, add shredded cheese, fresh green peas and serve them with melted butter or even tomato sauce. I used whole wheat flour for my recipe, but you are welcome to use all-purpose flour, that way your dumplings will come out whiter and lighter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you know, I was born and grew up in St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad). From my childhood memories I remember most popular breakfast of the time &#8211; omelet with onions, tomatoes, any cooked meat and fresh herbs. It was something known to everyone and cooked in great variety of ways. This omelet does not have any “official” name, but I have nicknamed it “po Leningradsky” (“Leningrad omelet”), in honor of my old city. The omelet is fresh, colorful and fulfilling, you can use any leftover cooked meat or cold cuts and it can be done in 15 minutes. It is great breakfast dish in one pan for the whole family. For fresh herbs you can use parsley, dill, cilantro or scallions. Serve it with dark bread toast. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page. Step-by-step photos were taken by my 9 years old son Daniel. Thank you my dear little helper!!! Note: I like to do all my prep work before cooking, that way my omelet is ready in 10-15 minutes. Serves: 3-4 Ingredients: 1 Tbsp. olive oil or grape seed oil 4 plum tomatoes, cut into halves and sliced 1 yellow onion, julienne, cut into thin strips 1 [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use to love these little tea bread when I was a child and I still love them today. I buy them often in a Russian grocery store near by but always had a desire to bake them myself. Sushki are slightly sweet crunchy round pastries/cookies which are served with tea or eaten as a snack. They look like mini bagels but they are very dry and crispy. They are fun to make, actually, our whole family was making them &#8211; that is why our sushki look all different-)) It&#8217;s ok, we had some good time. I like them with poppy seeds, but you can make them plain or top them with sesame seeds as well. For more Russian recipes, visit the Russian Cuisine page. Hope you had a very nice Easter weekend!

					<description><![CDATA[When I was a child we were allowed to go by ourselves to the local food store for simple shopping such as getting bread or milk. Very often in my early age, I had basic grocery shopping as a chore. Our nearby bakery was nothing special. They stocked few varieties of bread, some breakfast pastries, as well as few cakes, were always available, but that was all. But sometimes, if you were lucky to come to the store at the right time, you could find a number of sweet treats behind the glass display. One of such treats was rum baba, soaked in sweet syrup, rum and covered with a white sugar icing. So once in a while, I used to come home from my shopping trip with an extra item. Nobody complained, of course, tea kettle was immediately put on and sweet baba was served regardless what time of the day it was. We have never baked baba at home, so I don&#8217;t have family baba recipe. Recently I have recalled some of my childhood sweet delights and decided to give rum baba a try. I used a recipe from Julia Child’s book and my baba came out just [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Winter farewell is a time of awakening; the beginning of new life. Since ancient times, people have enjoyed this time of the year. Festivals and carnivals are held all over the world: Chinese New Year, Venice Carnival, a holiday of the trees &#8211; Tu B’Shvat in Israel, Mardi Gras, even Groundhog Day, which was brought to America from Germany, and one of the oldest Russian holidays &#8211; Maslenitsa. Maslenitsa lasts a week; it is full of fun and joy. The main attribute of the carnival is blintzes. All week in every home, housewives cook pancakes for their families and guests. Blyn (pronounced “bleen” – the Russian word for pancake) &#8211; the symbol of the sun, which is gaining strength with each passing day, warms the earth and gives life. Every day of the carnival has its own purpose. The first day &#8211; a greeting of Maslenitsa. On this day, the first blyn is carried out of the house for ancestors who have already past away. It is believed that they see the sun first, as they are above this world. In later times, when people become poorer, the first blyn is given to the beggars. On this day people make [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved this cake when I was a child. It is not too sweet and has a perfect amount of chocolate. It was very difficult to buy in a store, people used to queue up in line for a long time to get that cake. That&#8217;s why we baked it at home very often by ourselves. I present you the original recipe, how it was supposed to taste, however, everyone had their own version, some made frosting differently, some used liqueur between layers. To me, this recipe is absolutely sumptuous as it is. I hope you will try to make it, please let me know when you do &#8211; I would love to hear your opinion!

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Povidlo&#8221;&#8211; Apple Butter is cooked from fruit or berry puree with sugar. Once fully cooked good povidlo looks like a homogeneous mass of brownish or dark golden color. In Russia, Povidlo is known for a very long time. One of the first mentions of povidlo occurs in the annals describing treats of the princely table. Povidlo is typically made from apples (the most popular one), plums, apricots, pears, strawberry and various combinations of fruits and berries. I would like to present here an easy and delicious recipe of vanilla-apple butter which you and your loved ones will definitely enjoy. It can be used as pancakes filling or as spread for your bun or toast to be had with a cup of tea or glass of milk. The delicate flavor of apples is enhanced by vanilla in this butter that really captures the essence of the fruit. It is well worth allowing it to mature for a few days before eating.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweet, buttery, laced with chocolate and fragrant with cinnamon, these beautifully twisted wheels is easy to prepare and you can serve them with a chilled glass of milk or some hot coffee or tea. Buns are pastry of usually round or oval shape. We all love buns since childhood – sweet buns with raisins, poppy seeds, jam, cheese,  sesame buns, French buns, Vienna buns, from bakery shop or home-baked. They are perfect with tea or coffee on your weekday or your holiday table. Buns are widely loved and very popular in Russia. There are many recipes, but I would like to share with you my own one. I think this recipe fits fall season perfectly; cinnamon and chocolate complement each other in it creating a unique taste. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.

					<description><![CDATA[The word &#8220;mannaya kasha&#8221;&#8211; semolina porridge, conjures up a lot of memories from my childhood and has a special meaning in the hearts of anyone who grew up in Russia. I&#8217;m sure that every baby who has started its journey into the exciting world of food, has had numerous early meals include this hot breakfast cereal. Absolutely any adult can recall at least one episode that involved a loving parent or grandparent spoon feeding him or her this lovely kasha, asking them to eat just one more spoon for the health of the mom, grandma, great grandma, (or anyone else they could think of). Growing up and entering grade school, there were again many associations with this particular meal. When someone didn&#8217;t do well physically or mentally, it would surely be noted that &#8220;he probably didn&#8217;t eat enough kasha (porridge) when he was young&#8221;, and one of the first sentences the kids learned to read would most likely have been &#8220;Masha eating Kasha&#8221;. I won&#8217;t risk giving you a recipe of the hearty breakfast (un)loved by so many kids but will offer you something much tastier, and maybe you can build your own associations with this dish. This recipe transforms [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Keks&#8221; &#8211; Russian tea cakes are a tradition in Russian households and have been since the last century when the technology was perfected for milling fine, smooth white flour. Before, lemons were prized for there medicinal and cosmetic qualities. Today, at breakfast, lemon tea cakes enriched with honey are perfect for a cup of coffee or aromatic tea. Note:&#160;I have leftover Cream Cheese Frosting, so I spread a little on my cakes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m entertaining this weekend, and when one particular friend of mine comes over, I always make sure this is on the menu – my ricotta pancakes with berry coulis is her absolute favorite! If you love a good breakfast and you haven&#8217;t tried this, make it with me. Mixing cornmeal, which is a little gritty, in the batter gives these pancakes just a little crunch. Berry sauce with freshly whipped cream, makes them awfully good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shrovetide (or “maslenitsa” in Russian) is celebrated in the last week before Christian Orthodox Great Fast, seven weeks before Easter. Shrovetide is the holiday preserved by Slavic peoples from pagan (pre-Christian) times. Those days it was called differently when just like many other nations, ancient Slavs had traditional feast associated with winter wires and meeting of spring. At the time this feast was associated with the name of Veles &#8211; god of fertility and livestock in ancient Slavs pantheon. This holiday represented the awakening of nature from winter sleep and marked the beginning of the work in the fields. Also, the feast table must have been plentiful and very hearty as it was meant to manifest the hope for the harvest year. Time of this holiday has always been cheerful and it was believed those who refuse to be merry would end up living “in bitter trouble” for the rest of the year. After the adoption of Christianity in Russia, this holiday has remained a special time of the year, even though it was considered peoples rather than Church holiday. During 16th century name “maslenitsa” got firmly attached to this fun season which lasts seven days. Church statutes prohibited eating [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“Khvorost” (i.e. brushwood) is the Russian name of semi-dessert deep fat fried pastry. It originates from Southern Russia of 17th century where bakers have borrowed it from Greek cuisine. In second half of 17th century it has spread to regions of Ukraine where local cooks and bakers come up with their versions of this pastry. They named it “verguny” which is quite popular Ukrainian dish. Into Russian cuisine itself, into kitchens of St. Petersburg and Moscow, “verguny” has arrived in second half of 19th century and become liked primarily by inhabitants of large urban areas due to easiness of cooking and for being unpretentious product. At the same time Russian word “khvorost”, i.e. brushwood became a nickname for the dish, due to its crunchiness, but obviously not due to the taste. “Verguny” or “khvorost” was primarily cooked by medium and small income townsfolk: burghers, shopkeepers, clerks, students, members of work cooperatives – anywhere people needed to throw inexpensive quick feast not requiring utensils, by chipping in for the food. Today in Russia everyone knows and likes “khvorost”, it is often cooked for the holiday table. I remember my mom making it &#8211; first twisting and braiding dough and then flying [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today we open our Russian Monday section with the recipe of &#8220;Medovik&#8221; &#8211; Russian Honey cake dedicated to all athletes competing at the Olympic Games in Sochi! The mere name of the Honey cake evokes memories of a pleasant evening spent over a cup of tea or a fun child’s birthday party. Real homemade &#8220;Medovik&#8221; is delicate, delicious, fragrant and not at all sugary dessert that even person who can’t stand honey would never refuse. There is an interesting story about Empress Elizabeth, wife of Russian Emperor Alexander I. She did not like honey, all Court cooks knew about it and made sure never to use honey in their recipes. However, once there was a new ambitious young cook who has been just accepted to work for the Court and was eager to impress everyone with his talents. His recipe was brand new and indeed his cake has been warmly welcomed and deserved the highest praise of the Empress – layers with custard were literally melting in the mouth.  When she asked about ingredients of the cake, the young cook has been embarrassed to answer, because someone has already told him about Elizabeth’s dislike of honey. However, when he admitted [&#8230;]]]></description>
