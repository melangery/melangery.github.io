					<description><![CDATA[This is not your everyday meal, but rather a very special occasion one. If you have invited dearest friends for dinner or perhaps you’d like to spoil your family with a great dish, this is what you need to cook! It is complicated and time consuming, but it is worth every minute of your time. It has taken me total of two days, including preparation of broth and two fillings on a first day, and then putting a pie together and baking on a second day. You can probably be done in one day, if you don’t need to photograph every step of the recipe-)) It may take about 3- 4 hours, including homemade broth and everything else. Of course you are not going to cook this every day, but it is such a grand dish, very delicious and aesthetically beautiful. I hope you enjoy my post today, I put a lot of effort to bring this to you. Bon appetite! For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page. Chicken pie (“kurnick” in Russian) is the most famous of Russian pies, the king of pies, peak of national culinary arts. It is known from historical documents of the time, chicken [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many people, when they think of duck, think only of roast duck. In reality there are so many interesting ways to prepare duck that, with the real connoisseurs, roast duck often takes a a back seat. For instance, steamed or boiled duck may be attractively combined with vegetables in Chinese-style recipes. Or duck may be braised and served with any one of a number of delicious sauces. But, personally I always come back to roasting the duck, with different herbs, spices, fruits and grains. Here is a recipe I created for upcoming holidays &#8211; roasted duck, with ginger and sweet honey, stuffed with lemons. I served it with fried pan buttery quince and few fermented and pickled vegetables. If you looking to cook something different for Christmas I hope you will try my recipe for simple roasted duck. Back in Russia my mom often cooked roast duck for the holidays. I remember the aroma in our tiny kitchen when duck stuffed with apples has been served with buckwheat or sauerkraut after being roasted for a long time. I did not like it as much then as I love it today. But this also brings me a lot of joy to [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nobody knows exact origin of golubtsy (pronounced in Russian as “go-loob-zy”), i.e. Russian traditional stuffed cabbage dish, neither origin of its name. One thing is for certain – this dish is tasty, satisfying and impossible to get bored with due to tens of variations of the same recipe. One of such variations is named “lazy golubtsy”. Usually it is a good option when you don’t have much time to wrap traditional forcemeat with rice into cabbage leaves, or simply don’t want to bother with that. In such case stuffing can be placed in layers between cabbage leaves, or simply mixed together with shredded cabbage. I would like to offer you the recipe passed to me by my mom. Full tablespoon of sour cream is a perfect condiment to serve with golubtsy. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page. Lazy Style Cabbage Rolls]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In serious Russian cookbooks potato salads always merit to get chapter of their own. This is because potato salad is not just salad with potatoes, like “Vinegrette” or &#8220;Olivier&#8221;, you are already familiar with, but rather whole category of salads, in which potatoes are the leading ingredient. This particular kind of salad does not require young small potatoes (although, I like to use new potatoes for this salad), the important factor is if the kind of potatoes you use would keep their shape after boiling and can be easily cut in cubes or slices that would not break when mixing with other ingredients. Usually it is recommended to boil potatoes unpeeled. It is important to avoid over-boiling, so in order to check readiness you can use fork to poke a potato or two and if you can penetrate them without an effort – your potatoes are ready.

					<description><![CDATA[March can be a very tricky month. One day the sun is shining and birds are singing, but the next day you wake up and find a pile of snow from the overnight snowstorm on your doorstep. That is what happened to us a couple of days ago. The school was canceled, train service was suspended and life came to a complete standstill. My family was very happy; the fireplace was burning and I have treated my husband and kids with Russian traditional meal. The cooking took me 40 minutes most, simple and rustic, but very unique and delicious. Our day off was perfect &#8211; good food, the beautiful snowy view from our dining room and cozy atmosphere. We would like to see the first spring flowers but have yet enjoyed one of the last tricks winter has played on us. Welcome to our home!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recipes using ground meat were very popular when I lived in Russia, probably because ground meat is the kind of ingredient that allows a lot of variety. &#160;Potato casserole with ground meat is the dish used to be cooked by our moms and grandmas. I don’t know the origins of it, but I can say for sure that it is a traditional dish of Russian cuisine. My recipe of potato casserole includes only two ingredients – potatoes and ground meat, everything else is optional. If you would like to make a tasty dinner for a large family and get it done quickly – my casserole is for you. Potato-meat casserole can also be cooked with a variety of vegetables – cauliflower, broccoli etc. Vegetables can be mixed and matched in any variations. Also, pretty much any type of ground meat goes – pork, beef or a mix. Before using ground meat for your casserole, fry it with caramelized onions or chopped garlic to give it some extra flavor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good hearty buckwheat kasha is a serious matter. It’s a thing in itself crowning the whole of Russian cuisine. It requires a responsible and thorough approach when cooking with it, but the rewards are hundredfold. You will appreciate it when, after one helping of kasha, you will reach out for the second one. Today’s recipe is the old inherited one, from along time ago used in Russia &#8211; buckwheat with wild mushrooms. On its own, buckwheat porridge is very tasty and healthy, but with the addition of cooked mushrooms you won’t be able to pull yourself away from it. This recipe is not just to everyone’s liking, but it’s also vegetarian, gluten free and dairy free (unless you serve it with sour cream). Fresh mushrooms can also be used, but buckwheat will be the aroma of the dish and it is the best with the dried ones. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zrazy is a dish of Lithuanian, Belarusian, Polish and Ukrainian cuisines. Word “zrazy” is of polish origin, it means “slices”, “cut pieces” of something. Despite its Polish name, for the first time the dish is mentioned in the Lithuanian historical records of 14th century. Initially, zrazy were meat chops stuffed with eggs and vegetables. Later on, name zrazy started being used for potato cakes stuffed with mushrooms, meat, vegetables. Potato zrazy with meat is the most popular and nutritious version of this dish. &#160;Meat for stuffing you can pick depending on your taste – pork, chicken or lean beef would fit perfectly. Most suitable potatoes for zrazy are the ones which get boiled soft fast. I hope you enjoy my step-by-step recipe photos. &#160;Potato Cutlets &#8211; is really delicious dish, I wish you will love it too. Try to make it at your kitchen and let me know about your cooking adventure. Have a lovely day. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Pozharsky cutlets have become a popular dish of the Russian cuisine at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name and origin are attributed to prince Pozharsky, one of the noblemen of the time. &#160;Moscow’s crown prince was visiting, and Pozharsky’s favorite veal cutlets were to be served. But as ill luck would have it, no fresh veal was found in any of Pozharsky’s kitchens. To save the day, the prince ordered his chef to prepare the cutlets with chicken. The dish was so much to the liking of the crown prince, that he asked for its recipe. Since then, these chicken cutlets have spread through the kitchens of the nobility and later on, they became popular among ordinary people. The Pozharsky’s cutlets have acquired most of their fame during Pushkin’s time when the traveler had to take the stagecoach in order to get from St. Petersburg to Moscow. Exactly half-way between the two cities there was a stop at a small town named Torzhok, the residence of the Pozharsky family. In one of his poems, the great poet wrote: Have pit stop for a dinner, At Pozharsky’s Torzhok And taste some sizzling cutlets To make your road light… [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My recipe of Stuffed Cabbage Rolls became very popular, and now I would like to present you a liter version of the same. It is vegetarian, gluten-free and, if you omit sour cream, it would be dairy free also. New Year always starts with new resolutions and eating healthy is often one of them. So why not to make healthy food to taste great as well? Stuffed cabbage rolls can be your main dish or side to roasted chicken or beef. Also this time I have used a different type of cabbage with a softer texture and sweeter taste. All around, it is a simple dish with many beautiful flavors. Cabbage is a vegetable which is often overlooked. The Vegetarian Stuffed Cabbage Rolls with Quinoa, Onions &#38; Carrots are richly flavored with tomatoes, white wine, and herbs.

					<description><![CDATA[This warm, spicy marinate with its rich partnership of flavors is a perfect complement to lightly fried fish, such as cod, bass, sea bass or tilapia. “Marinade” is a carrot-onion sauce that the fish is covered and served with. This dish can be served hot with mashed potatoes or at room temperature as an appetizer. And the good thing is &#8211; you can make it a day before serving! Try it, you&#8217;ll thank me later-) &#8220;To marinade (from Latin “marinus” – marine) is a method of cooking utilizing strong brine – marinade. First marinades have appeared in ancient Rome and were as simple as sea water used to soak meat, fish, and poultry in order to mitigate or impart other flavors. Use of seawater as first natural marinade was known to almost all “sea” peoples. In Scandinavia and Finland to the day certain caught sea fish is not only soaked but also boiled in the same water the fish lived in. Gradually, more complex marinades have developed, each with its own character and for a different product: meat, fish, mushrooms, vegetables, and fruits. In Southern Europe, with its developed winemaking, vinegar gradually has replaced salt and enabled to marinate fruits [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stuffed cabbage or golubtsy (“go-lub-tzy”) in Russian is a dish of Middle Eastern as well as European cuisine. This name usually refers to ground beef mixed with boiled rice or buckwheat wrapped in cabbage leaves. However, there are many varieties of fillings and the dish is popular in a many countries – Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Balkan countries, Moldova, Russian, Turkey, and Ukraine etc. Stuffed cabbage is easy to cook, but the origins of this dish are somewhat confusing. Word “golubets” in medieval Russian meant name of the dance or structure made of logs. This word started being used as name of the dish from approximately mid-18th century when Russian food culture has been under great European, especially French cuisine influence. At the time among aristocracy grilled dove was a widespread dish; however, not everyone could afford it. Hence, some started cooking “fake doves” made of minced meat wrapped in cabbage leaves. Word “dove” in Russian sounds like “golub” and hence those “fake doves” got nickname of “golubtsy” (i.e. “small doves”, plural). Slowly, “fake doves” became more popular than the real ones but nickname stuck to the dish – “golubtsy”. In Turkey golubtsy were never about stuffed cabbage.

					<description><![CDATA[Today in our Russian section we present “Kulebyaka”. This traditional pie is an ideal dish for special occasions and it makes a perfect brunch. My daughter helped me to make it – we’ve been preparing dough, making crêpes used in stuffing and decorated the pie together. As we were cooking, I have shared with her the story of this dish and how it should be served. I hope you are interested too, so here it is. “Kulebyaka” (or “kulebyak”) is a closed pie with complex staffing; it is traditional for Russian cuisine. It is mentioned by many writers in their novels, for example by Gogol in his “Dead Souls”. The main distinction of kulebyaka from other pies is its complex staffing. Often it’s made from few types of ground meat or fish, eggs, rice, cabbage, mushrooms, layered with crêpes to prevent different types of staffing from getting mixed up. When you cut the pie every slice of it has every kind of staffing. Usually, kulebyaka is made from yeast-based dough, but puff pastry or fresh dough also can be used. Traditionally, decorations are dough made “pigtails” or “branches” placed on the top of the pie which is greased with egg [&#8230;]]]></description>
