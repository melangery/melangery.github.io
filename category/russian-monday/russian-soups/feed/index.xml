					<description><![CDATA[As the weather turns colder and fall steps in, &#8220;cold weather soups&#8221; are an indispensable part of the menu. I would like to share with you one of my favorites &#8211; buckwheat soup!&#160;It is filling, super healthy and delicious. When it is raining or freezing outside, what else is better than to snuggle on the couch in your PJs, with a warm blanket, good book or film and a huge bowl of warm yummy soup? For me personally, soups are good in any weather &#8211; &#160;lentil soup, chicken soup, potato carrot, and definitely buckwheat soup are on my &#8220;short list&#8221;. But first &#8211; a little story. Today is a very special Russian Monday. One week ago, I was visiting my dear friends in Winter Park, Florida. They are also huge fans of my blog and my fine art photography. And it happened to be that Russian Monday is their favorite chapter on my blog. One thing leads to another and we found ourselves cooking Russian food for sixteen people for Monday evening. The menu was simple but creative. Our starters were roasted marrow bones with pickled onions, small sandwiches with&#160;fish, caviar, and vegetables, potato salad &#8220;Olivier&#8221;, and amazing cheese tray [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recall this soup from my childhood, my school and even kindergarten years. Pea soup is very rich, fragrant and delicious. It is also very good in cold weather. The cooking of it is quite simple and fast. 20-25 years ago you could get peas at any store in Russia in few varieties – yellow, green, whole or halves. The halves were especially popular for some reason, they were cheap and in demand. Pea soup in Germany is practically a national dish and usually is served with smoked pork. Similarly, in Netherlands pea soup is cooked from crushed green peas with pork. Russian version of this soup is cooked with potatoes and served with crackers or toast. This recipe is my grandma’s – she used to make pea soup with smoked ribs and served it with garlic croutons made in the oven. Fantastically delicious!

					<description><![CDATA[With great pleasure I am happy to introduce you to one of my favorite soups – pickled soup (or “rassolnik” in Russian). This is traditional soup of peasants and farmers, people working the land &#8211; hearty, tasty and cheap to cook. Today’s “rassolnik” is direct descendant of picked dishes of traditional Russian cuisine, some of which  included pirogue with stuffing soaked in cucumber or any other spicy brine. Four main varieties of “rassolnik” are made either with meat, fish, vegetable or giblets broth and pickles is mandatory ingredient in all of these varieties. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anyone who ever lived in Russia or Ukraine knows what Borscht is. It is very famous and favorite soup of many. There is a good number of different Borsht recipes in the world and I also have a few on my blog: Vegetarian Borscht, Chilled Borscht, Beet Soup with Sweet Potato, Borscht with Turkey Meatballs &#8211; just take your pick. Every time I cook this soup, I make it differently. This time I made Borsht with chicken broth and soft boil egg. I served it with a lot of fresh herbs and toasts. I cooked it yesterday for lunch, and my whole family were fed from one pot. Have a delicious Monday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mushroom and barley soup is one of my favorite soups since childhood. The only difference between now and then is that years ago the soup had to be made from dried mushrooms. Back then in Russia it was not possible to buy a lot of fresh food during winter time, especially mushrooms. Summer was a busy season for making jams, picking wild berries and mushrooms in a forests. However, to be used throughout the year these had to be dried and frozen. Only the best mushrooms (porcini mushrooms or the like) were used for drying. They were carefully selected, cleaned and hanged on the thread somewhere in the dry and warm corner of the kitchen. There could never be a lot of mushrooms, so the soup was made on special occasions. It was the best soup that I ever had, full of aroma complemented by nice texture of barley. My mom always used to add potatoes to the soup, but I like to cook it without potatoes. Now dried wild mushrooms are expensive, so I use fresh mushrooms and cook this soup very often. But still every time it reminds me of my early days at home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“Ukha” is a Russian word used to name fish broth or fish soup. In this meaning, it exists in the language for about 250 years or so, but before it was used for any fish or meat-based soup, pea soup or sometimes even sweet soup served with sugar. In the dictionary “Lexicon” published in 1704, “ukha” is defined as a synonym for “gravy”. There were three main kinds of “ukha” (soup): a white one with onions, yellow – with saffron and black one – with pepper, cinnamon, and cloves. During feasts and wedding receptions few different types of “ukha” were served accompanied by pirogues with various stuffing. This tradition exists to the day, except that variety of pirogues is much more limited. With time soups with noodles, cereals, etc. have gotten their own names and word “ukha” started being used only for fish soup or both cooked without grains. Recipe of 18th century describes the following sequence of steps: “The fish should be gutted, cut in pieces and placed in a pot. Caviar and milt should be put on top of the fish. Pour water or fish broth made from small fish, add dill, parsnip, lemon, pepper, and flour. Cook [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Solyanka (pronounced “so-lyan-ka”), a Russian word which can be translated as “grab-bag” or “hodgepodge” is the name of the dish symbolic in Russian cuisine known far beyond Russia. As a matter of fact, knowing the name of this dish is enough never to go hungry if you are a foreigner visiting Russia. For the first time “solyanka” is mentioned in the Russian literature of the 15th century and by the 18th century it is widespread and referred by two names – “solyanka” and “pohmelka” (“pokh-mel-ka”), which meant a greasy and very hearty soup served as snack with vodka or served as an entrée. Nobility, however, did not accept this dish at all, considering it a sign of bad taste and only commoners and poor people loved it since it was very filling and warming while being a good source to replenish energy after a whole day of hard labor. Solyanka also helped common people to drink without actually getting drunk. Solyanka can be thick or liquid. It is based on strong broths such as meat, fish or mushroom ones. Often it may contain smoked meats, franks, sausages or other sausage products. There are a lot of solyanka recipes but their [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This warming soup brings the summery flavor of basil to mid-autumn meals. Russian “kletsky” (pronounced as “klet-skee”) is a word used to name the dish known also in Ukrainian and Belarusian cuisines as “galushky”, in Italian cuisine as gnocchi, in Czech &#8211; as “knedliky” and so on. All of these dishes are flour made balls (sometimes also flattened into pillow shape) can be generally referred as dumplings. Usually cooked in broth or milk they are popular in Eastern Europe. In Belarus and Poland they are often served with lean meatless soup or sometimes fried with onion and bacon. The main secret of dumplings is tasty broth and properly cooked dough. Soups can include combination of meatballs and flour or potato dumplings. Autumn Collection: Still life with Green Pumpkins Fall is already out there and I am happy to share with you my first autumn still life composition from the new collection. I would be excited to receive your feedback. &#8220;There is something in the autumn that is native to my blood &#8211; Touch of manner, hint of mood; And my heart is like a rhyme, With the yellow and the purple and the crimson keeping time.&#8221; Bliss Carman, A Vagabond [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last Sunday, at bloggers conference in Orlando, when people were finding out I was born in Russia they have been asking if I have any recipes of Russian cuisine on my blog. Apparently, I had none. I just thought that on the internet there are plenty of recipes of cabbage soup (pronounced as “sch-ee”), cabbage rolls (“go-lub-tsy”) and perogys (“pee-ro-gee”). There are tons of these things around I would not dare to say final products look really attractive. On the way home I have been thinking about all of this, about my hometown of St. Petersburg, about my mom’s home cooking and the fact that I have graduated from the Culinary Arts Institute years ago particularly in my hometown and not at any other place. I would love to stay close to my roots and I feel that my cultural background comes out anyways in all of my creations – recipes, photos, and illustrations. My blog is a collection of all kinds of recipes, images of beautifully served dishes, and the main purpose&#160;is to serve as a source of inspiration for anyone interested in the culture of cooking and serving food. I have decided to start a new section dedicated [&#8230;]]]></description>
