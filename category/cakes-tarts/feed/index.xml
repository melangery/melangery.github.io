					<description><![CDATA[Line a basket or a pretty dish with a napkin and fill it with breakfast bakes &#8211; hot, tender, and a little sweet. Hearty and robust or delicate cake-like, all slices of quick bread have a place on the morning table. Chunky jams and preserves go well with full-flavored bakes, while the more subtle ones need only sweet butter, a little crème fraîche, or perhaps a spoonful of jelly. Some breads, such as those filled with berries, need no accompaniment at all. Quick breads are made from the same type of batter as muffins. They share the same uneven, sometimes cake-like crumb. They are breads usually feel with nuts and cranberries at Christmas, pumpkin puree near Thanksgiving, and zucchini at summer&#8217;s end when the garden is overrun with the squash. Quick breads very often benefit from being made a day ahead and wrapped tightly in foil to mellow their flavor, but I never can wait that long-) Inspired by: &#8220;Ancient Grains for Modern Meals&#8221; by Maria Speck]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[America&#8217;s love affair with the show about the lives and loves of family and servants in an aristocratic home across the pond is coming to an end as the series Downtown Abbey wraps it&#8217;s sixth and final season. We&#8217;ve been treated to melodrama of the highest order, with fast-paced plots, richly drawn characters and even more richly drawn costumes.  Oh, those costumes!  There was even a traveling exhibit here in the states of costumes and jewelry from the show. We&#8217;ve all had fun getting to know the Crawley family and their servants; watching them live life and some of them rather suddenly be taken in death. We&#8217;ve watched as characters have traveled, moved, married and remarried. We&#8217;ve seen some of them grow and change and others watch as the world changes around them. photos from pbs How will we say goodbye to so many characters who, thanks to writer Julian Fellowes, have delighted us so well for so long?! Almost everyone has a favorite quote from the dowager Countess with her kind heart but sharp tongue and even sharper wit! Downton Abbey has also been a feast for the eyes with, not just the gorgeous period costumes but richly beautiful [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ChristmasEve may be the most enchanted evening of all. So much legend, myth, and mystery, both religious and secular, are part of the night of December 24. And for those who celebrate Christmas, there are more personal and family traditions attached to this night than to any other night of the year. In some households, the main holiday celebration is held on Christmas Eve, with a big dinner and the opening of the gifts before or afterwards. In other homes decorating the tree and then setting out milk and cookies for Santa is the big event. I love to bake and share with family and friends something sweet and special every Christmas. This year I baked an amazing Luxury Chocolate Fruit Cake with Rum, so good that you wish to bake it for every holiday-)) I like a surprise ending to a nice dinner, and this elegant-looking cake, with its wonderful combination of textures and flavors, finishes this holiday meal with a bang. What is your tradition for Christmas Eve? My flower arrangements are getting better every day. This one one of my favorite. I have made a postcards from this beautiful image, if you like I will send you [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you baked your apple pie yet? Here is another recipe for an apple tart/pie you may like to try it. Almonds add a wonderful golden hue and crunchiness to the crumble topping for this tart, which makes a perfect contrast to the sweet, juicy apple filling. Adding apple chips is totally optional, however it brings extra texture to this autumn dessert. Serve the flan with vanilla or caramel ice cream. Coffee anyone? Still Life &#8220;Apple Season&#8221; by Yelena Strokin (I love this one!) My still life photograph is a life-size of the setup itself. I have printed it so large (40&#215;60) to see how it would look on a wall. Then I compared it with a small photo and came to conclusion that each version is good on its own. Large format is great for hotel lounge or a dining room wall. It brings some drama to the atmosphere and introduces an extra dimension to the room. On the other hand, small print (8&#215;12) of my still life is very special and unique. I like to frame it in a heavy museum quality frame and find a place in a house where I usually relax with a book and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you love the beets as much as I do that this recipe is definitely for you. On my blog, I have about twenty different recipes with beets, but there is nothing like this dessert. Chocolate and beets may sound to be a strange combination, but in fact, they go very well together. This cake has an interesting texture and taste, chia seeds give it a crunch and beets chunks feel like small pieces of fruit, very sweet and colorful. Coconut oil adds an amazing aroma to this unique dessert. Try it and see for yourself, have a little culinary adventure in your kitchen. Don&#8217;t forget to put a kettle on, while baking a cake-)) Inspired by Green Kitchen Stories recipe (one of my favorite blog).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This Lemon &#38; Blueberry cake is doubly enriched with the juice and zest of the fresh lemon. Poppy seeds stirred into an almond batter give flavor and texture. The blueberries and honey are natural partners: the sweet flowery flavor of the honey plays up to the slightly sassy blueberries. I can only say one thing &#8211; a delightful cake! Found in plentiful supply at almost any bakery, poppy seeds are a smart addition to your kitchen spice shelf. Of course, they&#8217;re wonderful on homemade rolls and bread, but try them with other foods. Sprinkle some over a platter of pale scrambled eggs or a mound of home fries, or bake a batch of sour cream muffins. Poppy seeds bring extra crunch to this Lemon &#38; Blueberry Cake, making the dessert more exciting and tasteful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I hear about mix of ricotta cheese with lemon, I start drooling-))  This cake has everything and more: it is flour-less with almond meal, so you don&#8217;t have to feel guilty after a few slices. It is very moist and not too sweet. It is also lemony and has crunchy top. You can not ask for anything else, it is a perfection itself! I love to have slice of this cake for breakfast with cup of fresh brewed coffee. Bake it the night before so in the morning you have a great treat to start your day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved this cake when I was a child. It is not too sweet and has a perfect amount of chocolate. It was very difficult to buy in a store, people used to queue up in line for a long time to get that cake. That&#8217;s why we baked it at home very often by ourselves. I present you the original recipe, how it was supposed to taste, however, everyone had their own version, some made frosting differently, some used liqueur between layers. To me, this recipe is absolutely sumptuous as it is. I hope you will try to make it, please let me know when you do &#8211; I would love to hear your opinion!

The monks cooked this creusois cake in ceramic tiles that were themselves creuses &#8211; hollow, concave, or curved… Meltingly soft and tender, it is said that each morsel of the gateau creusois reveals the beauty, savory delight, and charm of its place of origin: La Creuse, in the heart of France&#8221;. from French Country Cooking by Francoise Branget]]></description>

Taste of Bucks County: Peddler&#8217;s Village&#160;by Debbi PinciottiPhotography and recipe by Yelena Strokin Driving past suburban developments, then past the fields and farms dotted with beautiful, classic stone houses, visitors to Bucks county might find themselves at one of the most charming destinations in eastern Pennsylvania, Peddler&#8217;s Village. About halfway between the Bucks county seat of Doylestown and the famously artsy river town of New Hope, Peddler&#8217;s Village is a collection of lovely, unique little shops and restaurants, housed in colonial style buildings. Most of the shops are situated around a gorgeously landscaped, well-maintained &#8220;village green&#8221;, which is bordered by cobblestone walkways lined with hanging baskets full of seasonal flowers. There&#8217;s also a picturesque pond, complete with frogs. The Village even boasts a moving water wheel which, though only decorative, still adds to the Old World charm of the place. Yearly festivals and events include the Strawberry and Apple festivals, as well as scarecrow and gingerbread house competitions. Merchants at Peddlers Village carry everything from jewelry, clothing and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love everything about fall &#8211; from kids finally going back to school to the turning leaves and the crisp air.  Of course, I look forward to visiting various pumpkin patches, farmers markets, but mostly I&#8217;m excited to go apple picking at some of our local orchards that offer over 30 varieties of apples.  I will be reporting back on those in the next few weeks, but to help you get you in the Autumn mood right now, I have highlighted some of my favorites fall recipes. So if you&#8217;re like me, I hope you will get inspired by the autumns&#8217; seasonal ingredients, and cook up one of the dishes I have rounded up here: Apple Torte with Cranberries and Raisins Apple Strudel Limoncello Apple Fritters Apple and Honey Madeleines Apple, Lemon Cake with Hazelnuts Apple Dumplings Stuffed with Dry Fruits and served with Homemade Caramel Sauce]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Before posting the second story from my Food Blog Forum trip, I would like to share with you the recipe for this moist and colorful cake, which I find the perfectly fitting beginning of September. If you like carrot cake, this one would also match your taste. Don&#8217;t be afraid to use too many vegetables, they all blend together beautifully. Let&#8217;s celebrate the first day of the harvest season with this cake (please scroll down for the recipe). Next day of our culinary adventure begins at the legendary Highland Brewing Company. Amazing local restaurants have served us many delicious dishes. For three hours we were able to taste the finest Asheville has to offer, paired with light and dark beers. It was quite a feast one would not forget for a while. However, the people made the event special &#8211; everyone so welcoming and friendly, sharing their experience with us and happy to tell us more about the food world of North Carolina. I hope you can get a feel of how grand this event was for me! A scratch-made buttermilk biscuit, with duck leg &#38; liver terrine, spare rib jam, peach-pepper jelly, and shaved jalapeño. This dish from The [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reminiscent of the crisp tops of berry corn muffins, these golden little cakes are absolutely irresistible. The cakes have a delicious sugary crust like a muffin top, but unlike muffins, the crumb is moist, buttery, and very tender. Serve them with tea, or pair them with ice cream or fresh fruit for dessert Inspired by &#8220;The Last Course&#8221; by Claudia Fleming (Random House, 2001)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Keks&#8221; &#8211; Russian tea cakes are a tradition in Russian households and have been since the last century when the technology was perfected for milling fine, smooth white flour. Before, lemons were prized for there medicinal and cosmetic qualities. Today, at breakfast, lemon tea cakes enriched with honey are perfect for a cup of coffee or aromatic tea. Note:&#160;I have leftover Cream Cheese Frosting, so I spread a little on my cakes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My eight-year-old son has a dream, he wants to open his own restaurant when he grows up. Every day after school when his homework is done he sits quietly and plans his dream. I have helped him to make a layout of the kitchen, put together a design of the tables and the milkshake bar. He even planned for a piano to be put in the corner for the live entertainment. He already knows what kind of people he needs to hire, he learns about walk-in freezers, pantry, and ovens. He started asking his school friends if they would like to take a position at his place and there is already someone who wants to take a cleaning job. Menu with special drinks and desserts has been planned, business cards design has been prepared. And now we are getting to the most exciting part &#8211; a cake. My dear son has asked me to teach him how to bake a restaurant quality chocolate cake. And there it is, ladies and gents: cake recipe for my son&#8217;s future family-friendly restaurant. It is rich, chocolaty with a crunch of almonds. This cake will melt in your mouth and with some mint chocolate [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To enjoy a lemon tart at its best, serve it warm or cold, but never chilled. For this recipe, I have used sweet pastry which is easy to prepare. Serve the tart as it is, or sprinkled with a generous layer of confectioners&#8217; sugar. It is delicious accompanied by candied kumquats or red berries in season.]]></description>
