					<description><![CDATA[Although, today is not a Monday but I feel this post is very appropriate for Easter. It was my husband’s idea to make a post about this salad. He loves it and remembers eating it back home on every holiday. The dish is very simple, but I am sure you will love the taste. Pick your favorite cheese or combination of cheeses. Amount of garlic is totally up to you, our family loves a lot of it-)) Also you can serve it on top of cherry or plum tomatoes, and fresh spring herbs would be a wonderful addition. Russian Orthodox Easter Day will be on May 1 this year. But I would love to wish Happy Easter to everyone who celebrates it this Sunday! Awake, thou wintry earth &#8211; Fling off thy sadness! Fair vernal flowers, laugh forth Your ancient gladness! ~Thomas Blackburn, &#8220;An Easter Hymn&#8221;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[New Year in Russia is considered to be a family holiday, but many choose to have their New Year’s party in clubs or restaurants, or while being away on exotic beach vacations, or in the country setting with the company of friends. However, most often, it is still celebrated at home at the festive table. The richness of Russian holiday table has always been impressive for the imagination of the foreigner. Variety of smoked fish and caviar, jellied meats and cold cuts, salads, homemade pickled vegetables, and mushrooms – appetizers are practically countless. Unfortunately, with time, certain common appetizers such as sturgeon caviar became delicacies and often are out of reach for many. However, this has not affected the richness of the festive table – smoked meats, sausages, hams, and pates have taken their place on the menu. Traditional New Year’s salads are “Olivie”, “Mimoza” and “Herring under fur coat”. A wide variety of salads is a must –  with meat, with mushrooms, with fresh veggies. Salads are usually served in large bowls rather than as individual portions. Pickled vegetables and mushrooms are all-time favorites. It can be pickled cabbage, dilled and pickled cucumbers, and tomatoes, smoked and salted fish, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vol-au-vent is a puffy tartlet from flaky dough. Dough raises up during baking and takes shape of a small cup or basket. Variety of fillings go into baked dough baskets  and they are served cold or hot. Vol-au-vents are of French origin, first time made by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême. Name of this pastry points to the type of dough used in it. The initial idea behind volauvents was to make them very lite as opposed to the ones made of shortcrust dough. There is another name for vol-au-vents – bouchées. Authorship of first bouchées is attributed to wife of King Louis XV, Maria Leschinsky. She loved small single bite type of foods and hence the name – “bouchées à la reine”, queen’s bites. Despite of vol-au-vents French origin, they are very popular in Russian cuisine, you can find variety of their recipes in old cook books of Soviet time. For more Russian recipes, visit Russian Cuisine page. My new still life &#8211; Zakusky: Traditional Russian Small Plates Vol-au-vents are popular worldwide as well. They are usually made a “single bite size”, but occasionally you can find large ones too stuffed with meat or fish. These usually are the main course and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been very busy over the last few weeks, doing a lot of creative things/jobs and also watching my latest favorite cooking show &#8211; The Great British Baking Show. You probably can tell, since I bake quite a lot lately, just cannot help myself, the show is so good. I just want to bake together with the bakers and I do. Also, I am taking classes of floral design and enjoying that tremendously. Work with flowers is so relaxing and comes to me very naturally, I feel like I found my new creative side. This is the reason why you have neither seen me lately on my blog nor I have visited yours, and I miss you all my dearest friends. As you can see from my photography, the fall is so beautiful here and I just can&#8217;t get enough of it. Soon the colors will fade, but for now every day is a holiday for me. Please enjoy the recipe and few clicks from my everyday life. Inspired by recipe from The Great British Baking Show.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you’re run out of ideas for sweet potato appetizers/snacks/side dishes, these potato roses are a very pretty and easy to make. It takes only 25 minutes to cook it and just few ingredients. “Summer was gone and autumn was on the doorstep. Leaves were just turning. Brilliant reds and yellows and amber maples dotted the gardens and forest. Some leaves had already fallen onto the grass of the village green. It was a perfect time of year, when late summer flowers were still blooming and the leaves were turning, and the grass was still green, but the nights were chilly and sweaters were out and fires were beginning to be lit.” from the book The Nature of the Beast by Louise Penny]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Halved acorn squash make perfect single-serving bowls. These make a great vegetarian main course for any day, but they&#8217;re also a festive accompaniment to turkey, chicken or roast duck. (This post has many beautiful photographs &#8211; enjoy them!!!) I don’t know about you but fall is my favorite season. I always feel romantic, very creative and adventurous during this time of year. I think fall is the best time for weddings and special celebrations. When trees start to change their color I just like to drive to the airport and fly to Paris (I wish!) One of my vivid European trips memories is smell of roasted chestnuts almost on every street in a city. It’s beautiful, don’t you think? So, here is my story about how I roasted chestnuts. I was driving around town and spotted a chestnut tree covered by nuts. I was so happy and ready to start gathering every single one thinking how gorgeously looking they are and what I can cook from them. As soon as I got home, I have immediately started cutting and roasting. I am nature girl, so if I see wild berries or mushrooms I pick them – to use in my [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chive flower is a the first flower I ate this summer from our garden. I was standing by the chives picking off the flowers to promote more leaf growth, and I thought they might taste good. They certainly do &#8211; a crunchy, mild onion flavor. I have since added them to few dishes, from baked potatoes to salads of every description. My favorite and most attractive is avocado appetizer with yogurt, garlic, and micro greens. Tip: Cut the flowers right off the plants (including the stem) when they are fully opened but before the color fades. Chives start flowering in spring. The young plants can keep flowering well into summer if the weather is not too arid.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The meaty texture of baby portobello mushrooms combined with creamy avocado, crunchy cucumbers, and fresh micro greens makes a substantial sandwich. Swiss cheese adds richness to this summer lunch. This version is especially good on whole wheat or multigrain bread. One week ago I have received a package from OXO with GreenSaver container and fresh cucumbers from Melissa&#8217;s Produce. I did not have a chance to try new recipes with cucumbers, so I have stored them in refrigerator in the GreenSaver and left for a business trip. Several days later when I came back home my cucumbers were still fresh and juicy and I made several meals using them. I am happy to have proper storage for my fruits and vegetables, especially in summer time, when we eat a lot of salads and berry desserts. OXO GreenSaver solves produce storage challenges: How to make the perfect summer sandwich with green vegetables and mushrooms. I was sent an OXO GreenSaver Produce Keeper and Melissa&#8217;s Produce bags of fresh cucumbers. I was not paid for this review. The sandwich recipe is my own creation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This dish already is thousands of years old. When I traveled through the Middle East I have tried hummus from street food carts and in fancy restaurants. Each hummus master would tell you a story of his unique recipe passed from generation to generation, but he would not reveal the recipe to anyone, of course. If hummus is made correctly, it is very pleasant and even addictive vegetarian dish. Some people say it helps to lower cholesterol. Hummus should never be cooked using canned chickpeas. Cooked chickpeas must be thoroughly peeled before use. Olive oil quality is crucial for hummus. If you’ve got a bottle of fancy olive oil and decided to make your own hummus, this would be a good reason to open it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These fishcakes are delicious, no matter how many you are going to make they will disappear in front of your eyes. Usually I have a few photographs for a recipe, but today I have only two photos for you, you know why? I have started eating the cakes from my photo shoot-)) They are great for a party, your friends are going to love it. You can make the tuna cakes few hours before the meal, but before serving put them in the oven preheated to 375F for about 10-15 minutes. The fishcakes will be hot and crispy, and ready to be eaten-)) Serve them with tartar sauce or Country Rémoulade sauce.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cauliflower Cake is a very fresh idea for serving your vegetables for dinner. This dish looks impressive on a plate and goes well with any seafood combination or roasted chicken. I really liked it the next day, we had it for breakfast with some avocado slices. If you decide to make it I promise you&#8217;ll enjoy this rustic cake. Inspired by Yotam Ottolenghi&#8217;s recipe from Plenty More.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though in every Russian family Olivier salad is made in their own way with some secret ingredient, like grandma used to do it, let’s try to remember  where this dish came from and give thanks to the Russian chief of French origin named Lucien Olivier who invented the salad any New Years table seems empty without. Famous salad Olivier has been coined by the chef Lucien Olivier in 1860s. Lucien has been not only a cook, but he also owned “Hermitage” restaurant at Trubnaya Square in Moscow. His restaurant could easily compete with any Parisian establishment. His crown dish was the famous salad nicknamed after him which recipe he kept in complete secrecy. After chefs passing story of his dish got surrounded by rumors and the recipe was considered lost. There were many attempts to find Olivier’s records, but nobody was able to do it. In 1904 few chefs have recovered the recipe based on their knowledge of main ingredients. The following ingredients were on the list: pressed caviar (0.25 lbs), two grouses, veal tongue, boiled crayfish – 25 pc, soy – 0.5 can, 2 cucumbers, green salad leaves – 0.5 lbs, assorted pickled vegetables – 0.5 can, capers [&#8230;]]]></description>
