					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Purple Spring&#8221; Still Life by Yelena Strokin 2016 &#160; My dear readers, I am sorry to disappear on you like this but I have been very busy lately and I have some great news for you. For a long time, I have been secretly wishing for my own photography exhibition. I always wanted to hold my still life exhibition and now it is really happening. I feel like my dream is coming true and I am giving myself the best present ever. But there is a lot of work, pressure and planning taking place in the background. That’s why I have no time to post any recipes, but I have so many new and good ones, especially for my Russian Monday. I will continue blogging after September. Stay tuned. If you are local or live nearby &#8211; you are all invited to the opening or any other day of your choice. The exhibition will be in a heart of very nice historic town &#8211; New Hope, Pennsylvania, with many shops, restaurants, galleries and even very old theater. It would be a pleasure to see you there! My exhibition name is: Glimpse through the Flemish window Location: New Hope Art Center [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You probably know the feeling when you just cannot even hold a camera in your hand feeling allergic even to a thought of taking pictures! Lately, I have been feeling like that for a couple of weeks. I have so many projects in my mind and things need to be photographed, but somehow I have absolutely no power to do so. Every night I fall asleep with one thing on my mind, hoping tomorrow is the day when I can start anew. Tomorrow comes, I am sitting with my cup of coffee thinking, yes today is a day, but first, I need to do this and that&#8230; I find many other interesting things to do like laundry or organizing closet or playing with our kitten. So by the time I finish there is already no time left for my studio and new masterpieces. Have you ever experienced anything like it? I don’t want to take a break or stop photography at all, but I feel like I need something to &#8220;reboot&#8221; myself. Inspiration? I don’t know… Please share your stories, I am sure you had times like that in your life. These three photographs I shoot today. They are beautiful, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Still Life with Oysters &#38; Lemons I am proud to share with you that recently my work has been featured on the covers of two sister publications &#8211; magazines in Philadelphia and Bucks County, PA. Also, they have published some of my recipes and more photos on their pages. Both issues came out last month, right on time for Valentine&#8217;s Day. I am very excited to see my still life compositions on the shelves of my local &#8220;Barnes &#38; Nobles&#8221; store, they look absolutely stunning!]]></description>
