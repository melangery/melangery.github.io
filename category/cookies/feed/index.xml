					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;The moment arrives at a different time for everyone, but at some point in February, those of us who live in cold-weather climates find that the novelty of winter has worn off. We lapse into an antagonistic relationship with the weather, cursing it under our breath and commiserating with strangers in supermarkets and trains. By the time this short month rolls around, 30 days have elapsed since the holidays, with at least another 30 to endure before reaching spring&#8217;s starting time. At this time of year, its as though a significant other is away on a long sojourn and we are left pale and lonely in the void created by the absence. Much of this has to do with how much we miss the sun and everything it brings &#8211; the way it turns up the lights n the great outoors, heralds the end of cold and flu season, and invites us to dash outside without a moment&#8217;s hesitation.&#8221; I found these beautiful words in &#8220;SEASONS cookbook&#8221; by Alfred Portale, while I was looking for an inspiration to bake something special for my dear husband. He loves to get up early in the morning when the house is still sleepy [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molasses cookies are my longtime favorite. I have many memories of baking them for winter holidays. Taste of freshly baked and still warm molasses cookies dipped into a glass of whole milk or hot tea is one of the memorable flavors of Christmas. Chewy texture and heavenly taste &#8211; what a perfect combination! And what is interesting, in this recipe with einkorn flour, you are not missing a thing by passing on the white flour in favor of a much healthier alternative. For my molasses cookies, I’m using a grain called einkorn. Today’s wheat has undergone series of genetic changes over the course of millennia with the purpose of increasing both yield and gluten content (hence, it is no surprise how gluten sensitivity is so widespread these days).  When you look at wheat’s DNA structure, it’s impossible to identify its relation to the original ancestor – they’re almost completely different grains. What is einkorn?  This is the most ancient and purest form of wheat on earth, with no genetic changes in modern wheat. It contains a different composition of gluten our bodies are more easily able to digest. Einkorn is even older than spelt. Many people with gluten sensitivities, in fact, able [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You probably know these cookies or have seen them all over Pinterest, in fact I have few different recipes of them in my folders. They have attracted my attention quite some time ago and I’ve been thinking of one day making an effort to bake my masterpiece. Now I am glad I did. So, the holidays may be over, but this seriously impressive dessert is giving me a reason to bake and celebrate winter. I was very surprised by the ease of the process and deliciousness of the end result. My daughter has helped me a great deal and we had a lot of fun baking. These “peach” cookies are beautiful, and Cooking Melangery is all about beautiful food. Lets start new year with creatively delicious treat! Inspired by all &#8220;peach&#8221; cookies recipes]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn’t it great to receive an unexpected gift?!  I think it’s amazing! My dear friend from “The View from Great Island” has sent me a beautiful Windmill Cookie mold made by HOBI Cookie Molds. It is hand carved from cherry wood and came with a booklet full of recipes, one of which I would love to share with you. Every Christmas I bake cookies from all over the world &#8211; it is my family tradition to try different sweets baked with old recipes. Today we have cookies from Holland. The individual windmill cookies are called speculaasjes. The Dutch word &#8220;speculaas&#8221; comes from speculum (mirror). The cookies are associated with the Dutch feast of Sinterklaas and are a favorite German and Dutch cookie at Christmas. They are honey sweet, full of spices, crispy and deliciously eye pleasing. You can send them as a gift to your loved ones and if they would like to bake the same by themselves, you may include the mold as well. I was so happy to receive a gift like that. Thank you, Sue Moran! For more tips about the cookies and molds, please visit here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been very busy over the last few weeks, doing a lot of creative things/jobs and also watching my latest favorite cooking show &#8211; The Great British Baking Show. You probably can tell, since I bake quite a lot lately, just cannot help myself, the show is so good. I just want to bake together with the bakers and I do. Also, I am taking classes of floral design and enjoying that tremendously. Work with flowers is so relaxing and comes to me very naturally, I feel like I found my new creative side. This is the reason why you have neither seen me lately on my blog nor I have visited yours, and I miss you all my dearest friends. As you can see from my photography, the fall is so beautiful here and I just can&#8217;t get enough of it. Soon the colors will fade, but for now every day is a holiday for me. Please enjoy the recipe and few clicks from my everyday life. Inspired by recipe from The Great British Baking Show.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#8217;t know if I ever told you, my dear readers, when my daughter was born, I used to illustrate stories for children. I could spend hours and hours creating my characters, making them move through pages of the stories. I have a couple of my favorite drawings from the time and I would like to share them with you. These are very dear to me. They are full of joy and warmth &#8211; two illustrations from the story about a little mouse afraid of thunder. Every evening when it was raining outside, in bed he covered himself with blanket shaking with fear like a leaf. But one evening his wise father told him a story, that rain is the voice of the sky, and the thunder is the sound of sky drums. The squeaking of trees in the wind is a sound of the violin and there is no need to be afraid because all sounds make one symphony of nature, one lullaby song for his son. And after this story, the little mouse has finally fallen asleep and had sweet dreams. He was no longer afraid of thunder and storm and every time it was raining outside he [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I bake Springerle cookies twice a year, in winter for Christmas and in spring for Easter. &#8220;Springerle&#8221; are traditional German Christmas biscuits which were used as gifts just like these days we give each other greeting cards for the holidays. It was a matter of pride to have a unique dough mold unlike anyone else&#8217;s, so the &#8220;baked greeting card&#8221; would be very special. Cookies were baked, put in jars and kept for six months. After a few weeks they would become very hard, but tasty, and in order to soften them up you would have to dunk them into tea or coffee. This is why Springerle was also called &#8220;dunking cookies&#8221;. Special molds for these used to be carved from pear trees. I got only three different molds like this and I love and cherish them. Maybe next Christmas I will make one more addition to my Springerle family. I have spent two days making these beauties with the help of my family. The reason this process takes so long is the need to dry cookies for 24 hours. But it is worth it, now we have seasonal gifts for our neighbors and friends. Cookies came out beautiful and [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you have never tried Canelés I highly recommend them, it is a classic specialty from Bordeaux, France. They are quite unlike any other petits fours and you are going to love them. Imagine a perfect bite of caramelized crêpe of a most delicious flavor with pastry cream melting in your mouth, crunchy outside and soft at the center. I had them twice at different places, once in &#8220;La Colombe&#8221; coffee shop in Philadelphia and a second time in Washington, DC at &#8220;Paul&#8221;, small French restaurant. After this last encounter, I have decided to bake them myself &#8211; first, because I loved this dessert a lot, and secondly because they were extremely expensive. I thought &#8220;how hard can it be&#8221; 🙂 So I have done my research, ordered silicone mold from Amazon.com and vualá! It was not very difficult, the only thing to pay attention to is the dough which needs to stay refrigerated for at least 24 hours or longer. So you will need a little patience in the process 🙂 I can tell you the truth; the first batch did not even make it to the blog. We have finished 2 dozen of Canelés in one day, my [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These orange ginger biscotti are delicious served with ice cream or on their own with coffee. They should be stored in a cool, dry place…but they may not remain there for long. Once you have tasted one, the sheer pleasure will tempt you to eat at least another couple, so I suggest you provide 3-4 biscotti cookies for each of your guests.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been making these cookies since I found them on the Williams-Sonoma site a few years ago. They have become a favorite recipe for my children and they call them &#8220;Zebras&#8221;. This recipe is not only incredibly easy to follow but it is also absolutely delicious. The meringues come out crispy outside, but soft and chewy inside. Impossible to resist! Inspired by&#160;Williams-Sonoma]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Anise is a favorite sweet spice in Europe, especially in the Scandinavian countries and in Germany. Our modern wedding cake is said to date back to the anise-flavored cakes eaten by the Romans after elaborate meals. Anise, a small annual plant, stems from the parsley family. It originated, in prehistoric times, from that part of the eastern Mediterranean which historians call the Fertile Crescent, probably because so many of our useful plans seem to have been born there. Anise was found in Egypt in 1500B.C., according to records, and is mentioned in the Bible. With the passing of years, it made its way to India, sections of northern Europe and, more recently, to the Americas. When the settlers of Virginia were making their laws, anise was considered so valuable that every newcomer was required to plant six anise seeds. Anise seeds are an appetizing addition to cookies, cakes, and sweet rolls. A pinch of anise used with fruits adds to their deliciousness, too.&#8221;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These delicious cookies are dainty enough for a tea party and yet hearty enough for afternoon snacks. They have a rich, delicately spiced brown-sugar flavor and are filled with pecans, dates, and raisins. If the cookies are not over baked, they have a better flavor and remain soft for a longer period of time.]]></description>
